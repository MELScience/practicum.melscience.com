step_by_step: |
  1.	To perform this experiment solid sodium acetate and solid sodium hydroxide are required.
  2.	Prepare a mixture of the reagents in ratio 1:1. Weight about 2-3 grams of sodium acetate and the same quantity as sodium hydroxide. Mix them thoroughly in a beaker or porcelain dish.
  3.	Place about 4 grams of the mixture into a test tube.
  4.	Seal the test-tube with a stopper with a gas-delivery tube. The gas-delivery tube should look upwards.
  5.	Fix the test-tube on a stand.
  6.	Heat the test-tube gently with the cold part of the flame. To avoid local overheating keep the flame in motion.
  7.	After a while the gas starts liberating.
  8.	Prepare an empty test-tube. Collect some gas keeping this test-tube on top of the gas delivery tube.
  9.	Methane is a flammable gas. To set it on fire turn the covering test tube and hold a burning match to the end of the gas delivery tube.
  10.	The gas burns with a blue (red) fire.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves. Methane is highly flammable gas - take precautions. 
science_background: |
  Methane is one of the chemical reaction products between sodium hydroxide and sodium acetate. The second product is sodium carbonate. This reaction is often used to obtain methane in the laboratory. Methane is a very flammable gas. It easily ignites and burns with a colored flame. If the substance is pure enough the flame is blue. If there are some other organic components as side products of methane producing reaction the flame turns red.
