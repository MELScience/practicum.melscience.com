step_by_step: |
  1. Pour a few milliliters of methanol into a large round-bottom flask.
  2. Heat a piece of platinum using a gas burner.
  3. Insert the heated piece of platinum into the flask.
  4. Observe the glowing of platinum pieces.
  5. If methanol vapor ignites, you need to blow out the flame. Observe the glowing of platinum again.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles.
science_background: |
  This experiment is typical example of heterogeneous catalysis.
  The reaction between methanol and oxygen does not proceed under normal conditions due to the high energy of activation. To overcome it, you can to file a spark, for example.
  In this case, the adsorption of reactants occurs on the large surface area of the platinum catalyst. The reaction mechanism changes and the activation barrier becomes lower. Therefore, the reaction proceeds under normal conditions.
