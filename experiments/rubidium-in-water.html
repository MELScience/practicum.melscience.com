step_by_step: |
  1.	Fill the trough about half full  with water.
  2.	Prepare a special device which will allow you to put the metal into the water keeping a safe distance. Fix the ampule with rubidium in the device
  3.	Put all the equipment under a safety screen.
  4.	Move away.
  5.	Break the ampule using the device. Rubidium will drop into water.
  6.	The reaction proceeds with an explosion.
safety_description: |
   The reaction is very rough! There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready. Use safety screen. There will be an explosion - keep a safe distance.
   Wear lab gloves and eye protection goggles or a face shield.
science_background: |
  Rubidium is a very reactive alkaline metal. When it comes in contact with water it reacts rapidly as follows:
  2Rb + H2O --> 2RbOH + H2
  A lot of heat is produced in this reaction. It passes faster than the same reaction of other alkaline metals (except for francium and cesium) because the alkaline properties increase with size of atom. Hydrogen formed in the reaction catches fire and reacts with the oxygen of air making the explosion:
  2H2 + O2 --> 2H2O
