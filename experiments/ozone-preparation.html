step_by_step: |
  1. Pour a few milliliters of concentrated sulfuric acid into a beaker.
  2. Place the beaker in a bowl with ice.
  3. While the sulfuric acid cools, prepare iodine-starch paper. For this, mix the solution of potassium iodide and the solution of starch. Moisten filter paper with the resulting solution.
  4. Add 1 spatula with barium peroxide in the cooled concentrated sulfuric acid.
  5. Observe the violent smoke emission. Insert the iodine-starch paper into the smoke. Observe its darkening.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Ozone is a poisonous gas! Work outdoors or in a hood.
science_background: |
  Barium peroxide contains oxygen in an unusual oxidation state which is capable of disproportionate and leads to the formation of ozone. By itself, ozone is unstable, so the reaction should be performed at a low temperature.
  Ozone is a strong oxidant which is capable of oxidizing the iodide-anions to free iodine. Reacting with starch iodine forms an iodine-starch associate which has a blue color.
