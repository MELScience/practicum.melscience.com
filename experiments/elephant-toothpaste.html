step_by_step: |
  1.	Prepare a hydrogen peroxide solution, liquid soap, potassium iodide saturated solution, and a bottle or flask. 
  2.	Mix hydrogen peroxide with liquid soap.
  3.	Add the solution of potassium iodide to the hydrogen peroxide/soap mixture.
  4.	Hydrogen peroxide decomposes and produces a lot of foam.

  Wear eye protection goggles and lab gloves.
science_background: |
  This experiment is based on the reaction of hydrogen peroxide decomposition:
  2H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> --> 2H<sub>2</sub>O + O<sub>2</sub>
  Usually this reaction is very slow. To speed it up the catalyst is added to hydrogen peroxide solution. Potassium iodide participates in the reaction but is not consumed and is recycled:
  H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + I<sup>-</sup> --> H<sub>2</sub>O + IO<sup>-</sup>
  H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + IO<sup>-</sup> --> H<sub>2</sub>O + O<sub>2</sub> + I<sup>-</sup>
  In this case the reaction of hydrogen peroxide decomposition begins and proceeds with high velocity. A lot of oxygen is released and its bubbles cause formation of foam.
