step_by_step: |
  1. Arrange 5 plastic cups from the Starter Kit in line.
  2. Add 5 drops of 2M sodium hydrosulfate solution Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> into the first one.
  3. Add 5 drops of 2M citric acid C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>7</sub> solution into the second plastic cup.
  4. Add 5 drops of 2M citric acid C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>7</sub> solution and 2M sodium carbonate Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> solution into the third cup.
  5. Add 5 drops of 2M sodium chloride NaCl solution into the fourth cup.
  6. Add 5 drops of 2M sodium carbonate Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> solution into the fifth cup.
  7. Take one more plastic cup. Add 10 drops of thymol blue and dilute it with regular water (still mineral water with no additives would be the best option).
  8. Stir the thymol blue solution with a black stirring rod.
  9. Distribute the thymol blue solution obtained in step 7 among the five cups you have prepared earlier.
  10. Thymol blue dye changes the color of solution depending on its acidity level.

  Why does the liquid change color?
  We have previously prepared five glasses, each with a few drops of different substances, and then added the solution of thymol blue to each of them. In each glass we get a different solution; molecules of thymol blue have fallen into diverse neighborhoods, and therefore they have behaved differently.
  Let us analyze in detail what happened in each glass. We will mark the thymol blue the same way, as shown on the experiment card: “Ind” (Indicator).
  Glass #1 (red)
  In the first glass we put 5 drops of sodium hydrogen sulfate NaHSO4 water solution. In water it dissociates cheerfully into three charged particles (called ions):
  NaHSO<sub>4</sub> --> Na<sup>+</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> + SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>
  In the presence of a large quantity of protons H<sup>+</sup>, all of the thymol blue (Ind<sup>2-</sup> – blue) becomes red H<sub>2</sub>Ind.
  Glass #2 (orange)
  Citric acid C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>7</sub> from the second glass also dissociates in water, producing protons H<sup>+</sup>. Moreover, each of its molecules can form a whole three H<sup>+</sup>! But, unlike NaHSO<sub>4</sub>, citric acid does it so unwillingly, that as a result much less H<sup>+</sup> appears in the solution than in the first case. Therefore, a part of thymol blue becomes red H<sub>2</sub>Ind, and another part becomes yellow HInd<sup>-</sup>. A mixture of yellow and red, just as when we mix paint colors, gives us orange.
  Glass #3 (yellow)
  In the third glass, a mixture of citric acid C6H8O7 and sodium carbonate Na2CO3 produces even fewer protons H<sup>+</sup>. Therefore, all the thymol blue in such a neighborhood turns into yellow HInd<sup>-</sup>.
  Glass #4 (green)
  Sodium chloride NaCl in water dissociates into Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>. But the water itself, as a matter of fact, contains a small number of protons H<sup>+</sup> (read more on that topic in Addition to this question). Therefore, we get a slightly green colored solution from yellow HInd<sup>-</sup> and blue Ind<sup>2-</sup>.
  Glass #5 (blue)
  In the last glass, thymol blue is present in its own form Ind<sup>2-</sup> and has, as its name suggests, the blue color.
