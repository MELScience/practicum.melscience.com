    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1.	Light the candle.
  2.	Pour some vinegar (about 100 ml) into a glass.
  3.	Add half a tablespoon of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) to the vinegar.
  4.	Wait for some time for the reaction to proceed.  
  5.	Carefully pour the gas from the glass on the candle. The flame will go out. 
safety_description: |
  Wear goggles and disposable gloves.
science_background: |
  When vinegar and baking soda come into the contact they react with the production of CO2 gas:
  2CH3COOH + Na2CO3 --> 2CH3COONa + CO2 + H2O
  CO2 does not support burning and can be used to extinguish fire. The gas is heavier than air and settles at the bottom of the glass. It can be easily poured out of it like a liquid. When CO2 is poured on the candle it prevents burning.
