step_by_step: |
  1. Grind in a mortar approximately equal amounts of sodium nitroprusside and potassium perchlorate.
  2. Mix the two substances on a fireproof surface.
  3. Ignite the resulting mixture.
  4. Observe a violent burning.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Work away from flammable objects.
science_background: |
  Potassium perchlorate is one of the strongest inorganic oxidants. Sodium nitroprusside contains  several atoms which may be oxidized. Due to this fact, the reaction between the two compounds proceeds. The proposed equation for the reaction is conjectural.
