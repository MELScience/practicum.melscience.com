    title: ALUM FROM WASTE ALUMINUM CANS
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Put about 30 g of potassium hydroxide into a beaker.
  2. Dissolve potassium hydroxide in about 200 ml of water.
  3. Cut an aluminum can to pieces and put them into the potassium hydroxide solution.
  4. When the can is dissolved in the potassium hydroxide solution, filter the solution.
  5. Slowly add about 52.5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid to the obtained solution. (A lot of heat is produced in this process, be careful!)
  6. Add 200 ml of water and heat the solution at stirring.
  7. Cool down and evaporate solution during a few days. Crystals of alum are formed.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab goggles and gloves. Avoid the contact of sulfuric acid with skin. 
science_background: |
  In the first step of this synthesis aluminum from the can reacts with potassium hydroxide forming potassium aluminate KAl(OH)<sub>4</sub>. After addition of sulfuric acid potassium sulfate and aluminum hydroxide are formed. Than aluminum hydroxide reacts with sulfuric acid in presence of potassium ions (from potassium sulfate). Thus, potassium aluminum sulfate (potassium alum) is formed.
