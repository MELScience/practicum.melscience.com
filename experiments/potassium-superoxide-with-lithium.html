step_by_step: |
  1. Install an evaporating basin with the pieces of lithium to the big beaker. Set the beaker behind the protective screens.
  2. Put some potassium superoxide into the basin and mix it with lithium.
  3. Add a drop of water into the mixture. Use a syringe with a long cannula, because there is a risk of fire and sprinkles.
safety_description: |
  Use safety screens.
  Wear eye protection.
  There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
  Make sure there is nothing flammable nearby.
science_background: |
  Potassium superoxide reacts with water to produce oxygen and  heat. This reaction initiates lithium oxidation â€“ a violent reaction accompanied by the release of large amounts of energy.
