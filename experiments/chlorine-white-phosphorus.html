step_by_step: |
  1. Fill a 1L-flask with chlorine.
  2. Insert 1 g of white phosphorus into the flask.
  3. Observe the intense burning.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Use gloves. Chlorine is a poisonous gas! Perform the reaction in a hood or outdoors.
science_background: |
  As a halogen chlorine is a strong oxidant. This property of chlorine is due to its position in the periodic table, high electronegativity, the lack of a single electron to fill the outer electron level and the low energy of Cl-Cl bonds. Phosphorus is a nonmetal that has reducing properties. It, especially white phosphorus, has a very high reactivity. Phosphorus is oxidized to phosphorus chloride, which forms the smoke. A large amount of heat is released which provides the ignition.
