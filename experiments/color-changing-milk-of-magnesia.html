step_by_step: |
  1. Pour some water in a beaker and add some milk of magnesia (approximately in ratio 20 ml of MOM per 1 l of water).
  2. Add a few milliliters of universal indicator solution into the beaker. The solution becomes deep purple.
  3. Add some vinegar into the beaker. The liquid in the beaker quickly turns red and then gradually restores purple color.
safety_description: |
  Avoid vinegar contact with eyes.
science_background: |
  Suspension of MOM has an alkaline pH. Because of this universal indicator has purple color. When vinegar was added, pH becomes acidic, and red color appears. Due to the neutralization reaction between the MOM and the vinegar, pH returns to an alkaline level.
