step_by_step: |
  1. Put some calcium powder and red phosphorus powder into a heat-resistant glass tube.
  2. Heat it with a burner. Calcium phosphide is formed under heating.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
  There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready. Make sure there is nothing flammable nearby.
  This experiment must be performed in a well-ventilated room or in a fume hood.
  White phosphorus which is produced in the tube is a very poisonous substance!
science_background: |
  Red phosphorus reacts with alkaline earth metals under heating. In the reaction under consideration calcium phosphide is obtained. During the experiment white smoke of white phosphorus is obtained in the tube. This smoke ignites in contact with air.
