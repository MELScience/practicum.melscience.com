    title: How alkali metals react with water and air
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Take a piece of alkali metal with tweezers.
  2. Cut it. Initially shiny metal surface quickly dims.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
  Avoid contact of alkali metals with skin.
science_background: |
  Alkali metals are very reactive. In contact with air the metal reacts with oxygen and forms an oxide. Thus oxide film is formed on the surface of the metal.
  In the series from lithium to caesium the reactivity increases and the metal surface dims more quickly. Rubidium and caesium give sparks if you tap on them with a glass rod.
