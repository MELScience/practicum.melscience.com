step_by_step: |
  1.	Prepare the flask. Warp it with aluminum foil.
  2.	Pour hydrogen peroxide into the flask.
  3.	Add about a spoon of manganese oxide to the flask at once. Stand clear since the reaction is very violent.
  4.	The genie escapes from the bottle.

  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves.
science_background: |
  This experiment is based on the reaction of hydrogen peroxide decomposition. Usually this reaction is very slow. To speed it up the catalyst is added to hydrogen peroxide solution. Manganese oxide increases the rate of the reaction but is not consumed during it. In the case under study the oxide is solid powder and probably its catalytic action is based on providing a large surface area and proper environment for the reaction to proceed. The observed fog is caused by condensing water vapor mixed with liberated oxygen gas.
