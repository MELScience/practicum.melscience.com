step_by_step: |
  1.	This experiment should be performed only in a fume hood.
  2.	Place some sulfur into the ceramic cup.
  3.	Put the cup into the large beaker.
  4.	Prepare a red rose. Attach a wire to the flowerâ€™s stem.
  5.	Hang the flower inside the beaker.
  6.	Ignite the sulfur and cover the beaker with a glass. 
  7.	After a while take out the flower. The rose turns white.
safety_description: |
  Sulphur dioxide is a very toxic gas. Perform this experiment only in a fume hood. Wear eye protection goggles and gloves.
science_background: |
  Anthocyanins are common pigments of many flowers. The red color of rose petals is caused by their presence. When sulfur burns it produces sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide. Sulfur dioxide acts like a bleaching agent. It oxidizes anthocyanins and turns the rose white.
