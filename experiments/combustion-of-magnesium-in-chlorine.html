step_by_step: |
  1. Obtain chlorine gas. There are many different ways.
  2. Collect chlorine gas into a chemical cylinder.
  3. Ignite the magnesium shavings over a gas burner or alcohol lamp.
  4. Quickly add the glowing hot shavings into the cylinder with chlorine.
  5. Watch the cylinder fill with white smoke.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Work with poisonous gases only outdoors or in a hood.
science_background: |
  Chlorine gas is a strong oxidant. Metallic magnesium is oxidized to magnesium chloride, which forms the smoke. The reaction takes place at the interface very slowly, so igniting is necessary.
