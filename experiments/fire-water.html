step_by_step: |
  1. Put small pieces of potassium into a beaker
  2. Pour some diethyl ether into the beaker  with potassium
  3. Add small amount of water
safety_description: |
  Diethyl ether and its vapors are very flammable. Don't use near fire or heater.
  Potassium is highly reactive, explodes with water.
  There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
science_background: |
  Potassium reacts with water and produces heat. Vapors of diethyl ether ignite because of this.
