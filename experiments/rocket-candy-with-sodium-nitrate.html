step_by_step: |
  1. Mix sodium nitrate and sugar in a ratio approximately 2:1 by weight.
  2. Put it on a incombustible plate (metal, ceramic) or into an evaporating dish.
  3. Ignite the mixture with a burner.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Perform this demonstration in a fume hood or outside. This is a violent reaction. Keep a safe distance. There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
science_background: |
  Sugar does not burn without additional oxidizers. Nitrates of alkali metals can be used as such additions. Under heating sodium nitrate decomposes with the evolution of oxygen, thus, the mixture of sugar and sodium nitrate intensively burns. The flame has a yellow color because of the presence of sodium.
