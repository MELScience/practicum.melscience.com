step_by_step: |
  This experiment can be done in two ways.
  The first way.
  1. Place potassium nitrate and charcoal powder into a trough.
  2. Heat the mixture with a match, or in a hot plate.
  The second way.
  1. Place potassium nitrate into a test tube so that a large part of the tube remains unfilled.
  2. Heat the test tube with a burner.
  3. Heat a piece of charcoal by the same burner.
  3. When all of potassium nitrate has melted, put the piece of charcoal into the test tube.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection and thermal protective gloves.
  There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
  Make sure there is nothing flammable nearby.
science_background: |
  Potassium nitrate decomposes under heating and produces oxygen. Oxygen supports combustion of the charcoal.
