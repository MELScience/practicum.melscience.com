step_by_step: |
  1. Preparation of anhydrous nitric acid. Mix 25 ml of concentrated nitric acid and 10 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid in a round bottom flask. Assemble the system for distillation. Distill nitric acid.
  2. Pour a few milliliters of anhydrous nitric acid into a test tube.
  3. Lower the small piece of white phosphorus into the test tube.
  4. Observe the melting of white phosphorus, the releasing of white smoke and the fire shot.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. NO<sub>2</sub> is a poisonous gas! Work in a hood or outdoors.
science_background: |
  Anhydrous nitric acid is a very strong oxidizing agent and reacts with nonmetals leading to the formation of new acids and nitrogen oxides. Therefore, it easily interacts with white phosphorus. The reaction with white phosphorus occurs very vigorously and is accompanied by an explosion. The formation of metaphosphoric acid instead of orthophosforic acid is explained by the lack of water in the reaction mixture.
