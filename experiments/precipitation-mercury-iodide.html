step_by_step: |
  1. You can use lead(II) iodide obtained in the experiment "Golden rain". Or you can get lead(II) iodide by mixing a potassium iodide solution and a lead nitrate solution.
  2. You have the precipitate of lead(II) iodide. Take a small amount of mercury(I) chloride and dissolve it in 10 ml of water.
  3. Add the solution of mercury(I) chloride to the lead(II) iodide.
  4. Shake the mixture.
safety_description: |
  Be careful with solutions of mercury and lead - they are very toxic! After the experiment, dispose the solutions of lead and mercury in a special way.
science_background: |
  Lead(II) iodide reacts with mercury(I) chloride and forms a bright orange precipitate of mercury(I) iodide.
