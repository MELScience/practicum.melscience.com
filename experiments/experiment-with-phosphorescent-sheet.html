step_by_step: |
  1. Set a phosphorescent glow-in-the-dark vinyl sheet in a dark room.
  2. Shine a red LED on the sheet. There is no glowing.
  3. Shine a green LED. There is no detectible glowing or a little bit of glowing.
  4. Use a blue and violet (UV) LED the same way. There is a bright and longer visible glow in this case.

  Donâ€™t shine LEDs directly into eyes!
science_background: |
  Phosphorescent glow-in-the-dark vinyl sheets contain ZnS doped Cu. For phosphorescence to arise, electrons of ZnS doped copper must be excited by sufficient energy. Photons of red (630 nm), orange (605 nm), yellow (592 nm) and green (525 nm) do not have sufficient energy to excite the electrons. But blue (470 nm), violet (405 nm) and UV (>400 nm) light photons can excite electrons. The greater the energy, the more intense is the glow. The maximum of absorption of light is 365 nm.
  During phosphorescence conversion of the excited singlet state to a lower energy excited triplet state occurs. Then all excited electrons return to initial ground state and emit the light with a wavelength of 520 nm.
