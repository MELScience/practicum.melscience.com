step_by_step: |
  1. Pour 30 ml of hydrogen peroxide and 20 ml of ethanol into evaporating basin.
  2. Light the mixture with a burning splint.
  3. Sprinkle potassium permanganate into the evaporating basin (keeps at arm's length, add about 0.5 g of KMnO<sub>4</sub>).
safety_description: |
  Use safety screens.
  Wear eye protection.
  There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
  Make sure there is nothing flammable nearby.
science_background: |
  Potassium permanganate reacts with hydrogen peroxide to produce oxygen.
  This oxygen locally accelerates  the burning of ethanol and the mini-explosions are produced.
