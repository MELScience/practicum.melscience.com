step_by_step: |
  1. Inflate a balloon with two liters of hydrogen from a gas cylinder.
  2. Connect the balloon to a vessel with fluorine.
  3. Turn on the supply of fluorine.
  4. Observe a powerful explosion.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Fluorine is a poisonous gas! Work in a fume hood or outdoors. The power of the explosion is quite strong. Keep away from experimental facility.
science_background: |
  Fluorine is the most electronegative element with an incomplete electron shell. Based on this fact, we can expect very strong oxidative activity of fluorine.
  Hydrogen is a good reducing agent. The well-known reaction between chlorine and hydrogen is accompanied by an explosion. Fluorine is a stronger oxidant than chlorine, therefore the explosion in this case is stronger, and the reaction does not require activation.
