step_by_step: |
  1.	The products of the chemical reaction under study have a very specific smell. Perform this experiment in a fume hood or outdoors.
  2.	Pestle to powder 1 tablet of urea peroxide (hydroperit) in a porcelain dish.
  3.	Add 2 tablets of analgin and repeat the procedure.
  4.	Wait for a few minutes. The Reaction proceeds with evolution of a large amount of white acrid smoke.

  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves. Perform this experiment outdoors or in a fume hood. Avoid inhaling fumes.
science_background: |
  The reaction between analginum (methamizole) and urea peroxide is complicated and is not fully understood. A very complex mixture of chemical reaction products is produced. One of the proposed explanations sounds as follows: 
  Both sulfo and methylamine groups of methamizole are involved in the reaction. The first step is the reaction of sulfo group with hydrogen peroxide:
  -SO<sub>3</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> --> H<sub>2</sub>S + H<sub>2</sub>O + 3O<sub>2</sub>
  At the second step the water formed in first reaction leads to partial hydrolysis of C-N bond. Methylamine is cleaved.
  2-NCH<sub>3</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O --> 2H<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>3</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>
  Hydrogen sulfide reacts with methylamine giving methyl ammonium hydrosulfide:
  H<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>S --> [H<sub>3</sub>NCH<sub>3</sub>]HS
  The suspension of methyl ammonium hydrosulfide crystals in air creates a visual effect of “smoke”. The specific nasty smell is caused by the presence of methylamine and hydrogen sulfide.
