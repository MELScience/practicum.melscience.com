step_by_step: |
  1. Ignite a candle.
  2. Put a glass or ceramic plate to the flame.  Carbon black is formed on the plate.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection and lab gloves.
science_background: |
  Candle wax burns to form carbon dioxide and water if it completely burns. If there is not enough oxygen for complete burning, carbon black is formed.
