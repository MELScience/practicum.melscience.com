step_by_step: |
  1. Take a long tube, hold it vertically, and place one plug at the bottom end of the tube.
  2. Partially fill the tube with the indicator solution. 
  3. Add a few drops of acid to the end of the tube and close it by another plug.
  4. Turn the tube over. The air bubble in the tube mixes the solution.
  5. Remote the plug (which now is on top) and add a few drops of base to the end of the tube.
  6. Close the upper end of the tube and turn the tube over again.
  7. The rainbow colored solution in the tube is formed.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection throughout.
  Prevent skin contact with acid and base solutions.
science_background: |
   There is a gradient of acid and base concentrations in the long tube. Because of the reaction between base and acid different pH-zones are formed. The indicator changes color in these zones.
