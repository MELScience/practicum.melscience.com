step_by_step: |
  1. Take a fire-resistance test tube. Fix the tube in a special holder or take the test tube with metal tongs. 
  2. Put a small amount of iron oxalate into the tube.
  3. Evenly heat the tube with a gas burner. Heat the iron oxalate till it turns black.
  4. Turn the test tube over and pour the iron on a refractory plate. You should carry this experiment out in a dark room for more efficiency.
safety_description: |
  The test tube MUST be made of heat safe glass. Use tongs or a holder for holding the tube during heating. Be careful with the gas burner. There is a fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
science_background: |
  A pyrophoric substance ignites spontaneously in air. Examples are iron sulfide and many reactive metals including uranium, when powdered or thinly sliced. In this experiment, finely divided iron has pyrophoric properties. It is obtained in the decomposition reaction of iron (II) oxalate:
  FeC<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> --> Fe + 2CO<sub>2</sub>
  Iron is very reactive, it flares up when exposed to air.
