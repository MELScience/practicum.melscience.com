step_by_step: |
  1. Obtain chlorine gas. There are many different ways, but you can take it from the cylinder.
  2. Collect 0.5L of chlorine gas into a chemical cylinder.
  3. Pour 2 g of antimony powder into a test tube and heat it over a gas burner or alcohol lamp.
  4. Slowly add the heated antimony powder into the cylinder with chlorine.
  5. Observe the rain of fire and how the cylinder fills with white smoke.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Use gloves. Work with poisonous gases only outdoors or in a hood.
science_background: |
  Chlorine gas is a strong oxidant. This property of chlorine is due to its position in the periodic table, high electronegativity, the lack of a single electron to fill the outer electron level and low energy of chlorine-chlorine bonds. Antimony reacts with strong oxidizing agents, like metals. Antimony is oxidized to antimony chlorides, which forms the smoke. Sparks are formed due to the release of large amounts of heat. The reaction takes place at the interface very slowly, so heating is necessary.
