step_by_step: |
  1. Put a few drops of mercury in a 50 ml beaker.
  2. Add 15 ml of concentrated nitric acid.
  3. You can cover the beaker with a glass.
  4. Observe the formation of brown fumes, how the solution changes color and mercury slowly dissolves in nitric acid.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Use gloves. NO2 is a poisonous gas! Work with poisonous gases only outdoors or in a hood.
science_background: |
  Concentrated nitric acid is a strong oxidizing agent. Unlike regular acids which have oxidizing properties due to the presence a hydrogen cation in their molecule, a molecule of nitric acid has a nitrogen atom in oxidation state +5, which gives very strong oxidizing properties. Due to this fact, mercury, insoluble in regular acid because of its location in the electrochemical series which is to the right of hydrogen, may be oxidized and dissolved in nitric acid. The color of the solution changes to green, because of partially soluble nitrogen oxides. Fumes of the solution are composed of NO2 (brown gas).
