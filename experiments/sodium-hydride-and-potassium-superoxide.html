step_by_step: |
  1. Pour some soapy water into a 1l beaker.
  2. Put a piece of sodium hydride and a piece of potassium superoxide into the beaker.
  3. When enough foam forms, ignite it with a long sliver. A small loud explosion will occur.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
  There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
  Keep a distance.
  The explosion may be very loud! Protect your ears.
science_background: |
  Sodium hydride reacts with water to form hydrogen. Potassium superoxide reacts with water to form oxygen. These two gases mixed together form an explosive mixture.
