title_name: Orange Juice and Strawberry Float
descriptive_name:  Orange juice turns to strawberry float. 
scientific_name: When acid is added to the solution an indicator changes its color and due to the presence of sodium bicarbonate a lot of carbon dioxide is released.

step_by_step: |
  1.	Mix together in a large beaker: 300 ml of water, 50 g of sodium bicarbonate, 50 ml of liquid soap and 100 ml of 0.2 % methyl orange solution. When the indicator is added to the mixture it turns orange and looks like orange juice.
  2.	Take another beaker and fill it with 250 ml of hydrochloric acid solution.
  3.	Carefully and quickly pour the hydrochloric acid solution to the previously prepared mixture.
  4.	A lot of foam is produced so it is better to perform this experiment in a large tray.
  5.	“Orange juice” turns red and resemble strawberry float. 
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves. Be careful handling acid and base solutions.
science_background: |
  The pH change and gas release are responsible for the magic transformation of orange juice to strawberry float. Methyl orange is an acid – base indicator. At the beginning of the experiment the solution pH is close to neutral. At such conditions methyl orange is orange. When acid is added to the solution pH decreases and the indicator turns red. Sodium bicarbonate reacts with hydrochloric acid forming sodium chloride, water and carbon dioxide. The released gas produces foam.
