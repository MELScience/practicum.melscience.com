step_by_step: |
  1. Take a piece of ferrocerium with tweezers.
  2. Heat it with a burner to red-hot.
  3. Abruptly drop it on the floor.
safety_description: |
  Wear eyes protection.
  The floor covering must be nonflammable.
  There are many sparks, be careful!
science_background: |
  Ferrocerium consists of cerium, iron, lanthanum and some other metals. Cerium has an ignition temperature about 150-180 C, and it forms sparks. When the red-hot ferrocerium rod smashes, burning particles of metal scatter.
