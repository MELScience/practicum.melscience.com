step_by_step: |
  1.	Take some solid gallium and indium.
  2.	Heat gallium a little to melt it.
  3.	Using a spatula mix it with indium.

science_background: |
  Gallium easily forms alloys with other metals. It is a common component in low-melting alloys. The melting point of gallium is about 30<sup>o</sup>C so body heat is enough to make it liquid. This metal is able to incorporate in a lattice of other metals. It forms homogeneous solid mixtures with joint super-lattice. Gallium alloy with indium (and tin in some cases) is a well-known example of eutectic systems.  Eutectic point corresponds to the defined temperature and alloy composition. At this point and above this point an alloy is liquid. Eutectic point temperature is lower than the melting points of individual components. Mixing two metals together leads to lowering the melting point. Eutectic alloys of gallium, indium and tin are liquid even at -19<sup>o</sup>C while the melting point of gallium is 30<sup>o</sup>C, indium – 156.6<sup>o</sup>C and tin – 232<sup>o</sup>C.
