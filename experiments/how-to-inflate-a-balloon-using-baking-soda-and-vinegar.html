step_by_step: |
  1.	Using a spatula add some baking soda to the balloon.
  2.	Pour vinegar into the bottle.
  3.	Fit the balloon on the bottle neck.
  4.	Simultaneously drop all the baking soda to the bottle.
  5.	The chemical reaction begins. It proceeds with evolution of a large amount of gas.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles.
science_background: |
  When baking soda and vinegar come into contact the chemical reaction begins. It produces sodium acetate and carbonic acid. Carbonic acid is very unstable and immediately decomposes to water and carbon dioxide. The released gas inflates the balloon.
