title_name: Whimsical precipitate of barium chromate
descriptive_name: The initial orange solution reversibly turns yellow with the formation of precipitate.
scientific_name: Barium nitrate precipitates only in alkaline solutions. The equilibrium between chromate and dichromate solution is shifted by addition of base and acid.

step_by_step: |
  1.	Dissolve some potassium dichromate in a large beaker.
  2.	Divide the obtained solution into two parts.
  3.	Add some sodium hydroxide to the first beaker. The color should change from orange to yellow.
  4.	Add some hydrochloric acid to the second beaker. No change takes place.
  5.	Prepare barium nitrate solution. 
  6.	Add some amount of barium nitrate solution to both prepared mixtures.
  7.	The precipitate is formed in the beaker with alkaline solution.
  8.	Pour sodium hydroxide to the acidic solution to shift the equilibrium. Stop adding when the solution turns yellow.
  9.	Try to add barium nitrate solution again.
  10.	The formation of precipitate is observed.

  Wear eye protection goggles. Be careful with the acid and sodium hydroxide solutions! Don't drink or eat potassium dichromate and chromium-containing solutions, they are very toxic!
science_background: |
  The occurring process involves the equilibrium between chromate(VI), dichromate(VI) and hydrogen ions. Chemical equilibrium behaves according to the Le Chatelierâ€™s principle. It can be stated as "When a system at equilibrium is subjected to change in concentration, temperature, volume, or pressure, then the system readjusts itself to (partially) counteract the effect of the applied change and a new equilibrium is established." The addition of acid shifts the equilibrium to the right, producing more orange-colored dichromate(VI) ions. The addition of hydroxide ions causes the concentration of hydrogen ions to decrease, and this brings the equilibrium back to the left-hand side, regenerating yellow chromate(VI) ions. Barium nitrate interacts with chromate ions producing insoluble barium chromate while while BaCr2O7 does not precipitate.
