experiment_name: Preparation of hydrogen using hydrochloric acid and zinc 
category: gases
reaction: 2HCl + Zn = ZnCl2 + H2↑
description: |
  Put several zinc granules or galvanized nails in a flask. Pour 30-50 ml of hydrochloric acid solution in this flask. 
  Because zinc is more active than hydrogen the zinc will be oxidized by hydrochloric acid to form zinc chloride. 
  Hydrogen gas will be produced during this process.
  Put a balloon over the flask opening to collect the hydrogen gas.
explosion: 1

comments: 
safety: |
  Wears safety goggles because hydrochloric acid may spray from the flask.
  Please note that it is an exothermic reaction - heat will be given off by this reaction.
