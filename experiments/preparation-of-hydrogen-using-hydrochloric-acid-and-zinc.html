step_by_step: |
  1. Put several zinc granules or galvanized nails in a flask. 
  2. Pour 30-50 ml of hydrochloric acid solution in this flask. 
  3. Put a balloon over the flask opening to collect the hydrogen gas.
safety_description: |
  Wears safety goggles because hydrochloric acid may spray from the flask.
  Please note that it is an exothermic reaction - heat will be given off by this reaction.
science_background: |
  Because zinc is more active than hydrogen the zinc will be oxidized by hydrochloric acid to form zinc chloride. 
  Hydrogen gas will be produced during this process.
