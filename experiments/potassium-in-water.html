step_by_step: |
  1.	Fill the trough about half full with water.
  2.	Put all the equipment under a safety screen.
  3.	Take the metal out from oil using tweezers.
  4.	Cut a small piece of potassium.
  5.	Remove the oil with a filter paper.
  6.	With tweezers drop a piece of potassium on the water surface.
  7.	Move away
  8.	A pink flame appears and an explosion takes place.
safety_description: |
  The reaction is very rough! There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready. Use safety screen. There will be an explosion - keep a safe distance.
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection goggles or a face shield.
science_background: |
  Potassium is a very reactive alkaline metal. When it comes in contact with water it reacts rapidly as follows:
  2K + H2O --> 2KOH + H2
  A lot of heat is produced in this reaction. It ignites the released hydrogen. Hydrogen formed in the reaction catches fire and reacts with the oxygen of air making the explosion:
  2H2 + O2 --> 2H2O
  The hydrogen flame is pink because of presence of potassium ions.
