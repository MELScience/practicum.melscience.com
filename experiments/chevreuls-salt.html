step_by_step: |
  1. Grind 2.4 grams of copper sulfate in a mortar.
  2. Put it into a beaker containing 25 ml distilled water and mix, until the powder completely dissolves.
  3. Dissolve 2 g of sodium metabisulfite in another beaker containing 10 ml of water.
  4. Mix the two solutions in a large test tube. The solution should become emerald green.
  5. Heat the test tube to boiling for a few minutes, using a spirit lamp or a gas burner. The dark precipitate should form slowly, and the solution should become discolored.
  6. Pass the resulting mixture through filter paper. Red-brown precipitate should remain on the filter.
  7. Examine the properties of the resulting salt. Add dilute hydrochloric acid and aqueous ammonia to small portions of Chevreul's salt .
  8. Observe the discoloration of the precipitate and formation of the blue solution, respectively.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles.
science_background: |
  Sodium metabisulfite has reducing properties. Therefore, part of the Cu(II) may be reduced to Cu(I). The reaction proceeds as ion exchange in this solution, which explains the formation of a red  precipitate of mixed salt, which contains copper in two oxidation states.
  After addition of hydrochloric acid, Cu(II) passes into the solution in the form of CuCl<sub>2</sub>, and Cu(I) remains as a precipitate of CuCl which has a white color.
  Cu(II) forms stable complexes with ammonia, soluble in water and colored in blue.
