step_by_step: |
  1. Connect a Bunsen burner with a hydrogen balloon in order to feed hydrogen via the burner.
  2. Take some palladium powder with a cotton swab.
  3. Open a burner outlet to feed hydrogen and introduce the cotton swab into the gas current. After a few seconds hydrogen ignites.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles.
  There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
science_background: |
  A mixture of hydrogen and oxygen is highly flammable and it is easy to ignite it. Palladium catalyzes the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, and hydrogen becomes flammable.
