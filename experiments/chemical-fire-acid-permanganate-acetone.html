step_by_step: |
  1. Take a refractory plate such as ceramic or steel plate.
  2. Put on a plate a little piece of paper or cotton wool. Pour a small amount of acetone onto the paper.
  3. Take a pipette or capillary tube and lower it into concentrated sulfuric acid. Be careful! You will need 2-3 drops of acid.
  4. Take a very small amount of potassium permanganate and put it on the fire-proof surface. Touch the potassium permanganate with the end of pipette.
  5. Touch the paper with acetone with end of the pipette. It lights up!
safety_description: |
  Be careful with concentrated sulfuric acid - use safety goggles, a protective gown and gloves. Keep a safe distance.There is a fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
science_background: |
  Potassium permanganate is a very effective oxidizer, however its dehydrated form - Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> - is a more strong oxidizer. This oxide is formed by the reaction between potassium permanganate and concentrated sulfuric acid. Manganese (VII) oxide is green:
  2KMnO<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> --> 2KHSO<sub>4</sub> + Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O
  This powerful oxidant may react violently with various reducing agents such as sugar (glucose), cellulose and others. Paper (cellulose) has the chemical formula (C6H10O5)n. But you see below the oxidation reaction of glucose and not cellulose. This is done to make stoichiometric ratios simpler:
  5C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 12Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> + 24H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> --> 30CO<sub>2</sub> + 24MnSO<sub>4</sub> + 54H<sub>2</sub>O
  Also, manganese oxide (VII) may react with acetone oxide, which is a reducing agent:
  5C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O + 8Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> + 16H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> --> 15CO<sub>2</sub> + 16MnSO<sub>4</sub> + 31H<sub>2</sub>O
  These reaction is exothermic, i.e. the mixture is heated in the reaction. Therefore, in addition to the oxidation of acetone by manganese oxide (VII), acetone ignites when heated:
  C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O + 4O<sub>2</sub> --> 3CO<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O
