  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves. Make sure there is nothing flammable nearby.
science_background: |
  Silver acetylide is a compound analogous to the well-known calcium carbide. It consists of two silver and two carbon atoms. Each silver atom is connected with carbon linked with anther carbon atom with a triple bond. This substance is very unstable. When it is heated the intramolecular redox reaction takes place. The silver atoms work as an oxidizer. Carbon atoms play the role of a reducing agent. As a result silver and carbon are produced.
