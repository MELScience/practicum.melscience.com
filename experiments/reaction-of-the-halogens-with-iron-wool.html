step_by_step: |
  1.	This experiment should be performed only in a fume hood.
  2.	Fill the cylinder with chlorine gas.
  3.	Cover the cylinder with a watch glass.
  4.	Take a piece of iron wool with twisters and heat it with a gas burner.
  5.	Put the wool into the cylinder.
  6.	Iron reacts with chlorine producing brown fumes.
  7.	Place a few drops of bromine into the test tube.
  8.	Put the iron wool into the middle part of the test tube. Leave at least 2 cm between the substances.
  9.	Fix the test tube on a stand. Clamp it near the top in a tilted position.
  10.	Heat the test tube gently to let the bromine evaporate, then continue heating the iron wool. 
  11.	When the reaction begins and iron wool starts to glow remove heating.
  12.	Place a few crystals of iodine into the test tube.
  13.	Put the iron wool into the middle part of the test tube. Leave at least 2 cm between the substances.
  14.	Fix the test tube on a stand. Clamp it near the top in a tilted position.
  15.	Heat the test tube to sublime iodine. Keep heating until iodine vapors donâ€™t reach the iron wool.
  16.	The reaction is much less vigorous compared to the previous cases. The appearance of grey iron (ii) iodide is observed.

  This experiment should be performed only in a fume hood. Wear eye protection goggles and gloves.
science_background: |
  Iron reacts with halogens producing iron halides. Reactions are exothermic and make the iron wool burn and glow. The more active the halogen that takes part in the reaction the more vigor it passes. These reactions clearly show that the reactivity of halogens decreases down the group 7. On atomic level it means that the larger the radius of the halogen atom the less activity it possess. The most vigorous reaction could be expected in the case of fluorine. Components react even if both are cold and there is no additional heating. Reaction is very rapid. The white or pale green iron fluoride is formed. Chlorine is less reactive than fluorine but more reactive than bromine. Hot iron readily reacts with chlorine producing reddish-brown iron chloride. To make bromine interact with iron some extra heating is required. The iron will become coated with yellow-brown iron(III) bromide. Iodine is the least active and the reaction is much less vigorous compared to the previous cases. Heating of both components is required to start the reaction.  Glowing is weak. Iodine cannot oxidize iron to +3 oxidation state. It canoxidize iron only as far as +2 oxidation state. The appearance of grey iron (ii) iodide is observed
