step_by_step: |
  1. Mix together the iron(III) oxide and aluminum powder in a ratio of 80:27 by weight. Take 16 g of ferric oxide and 5.4 g of aluminum powder. Mix thoroughly.
  2. Place the resulting mixture into a strong container such as a flowerpot.
  3. Fix the pot in a stand, put several layers of iron underneath it and put a fireproof bottom for whole system such as a concrete block.
  4. Insert the magnesium stripe into the reaction mixture and ignite.
  5. Watch the formation of the melt flowing through the metal sheets.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Flammable! Use a fire-resistant workplace. Use a hood or carry out the experiment outdoors away from flammable objects. Maximum protection the place of the reaction.
science_background: |
  Thermite is widely used in both civil and military purposes. Aluminum is a more active metal than iron and stands in the electrochemical series of metals activity more left. Due to this fact, aluminum may reduce iron from iron compounds, including oxide, and forms a more stable compound – aluminium oxide. The difference in the strength of the bond Fe-O and Al-O is so great that a large amount of heat is released during the reaction, which can melt the resulting iron. In turn, iron plates are destroyed by the melt.
  The reaction takes place in solid phase, it has very high activation energy, and therefore it's necessary to use a burning magnesium stripe as an initiator.
