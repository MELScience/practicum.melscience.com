step_by_step: |
  1. Fill a flask with chlorine and close it.
  2. Connect a glass tube with a LPG balloon using a flexible hose.
  3. Open a LPG feed and ignite the gas.
  4. Open the flask and put the glass tube inside.  LPG burns in chlorine forming dense black smoke.

  Wear eye protection and lab gloves.
  There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready. Make sure there is nothing flammable nearby.
  This experiment must be performed in a well-ventilated room or in a fume hood.
science_background: |
  Liquid petroleum gas (LPG) consists of propane and butane. They react with chlorine forming hydrogen chloride and carbon. It is carbon which forms black smoke.
