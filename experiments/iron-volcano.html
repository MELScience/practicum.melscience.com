step_by_step: |
  1.	This experiment demonstrates the eruption of an iron volcano.
  2.	First let’s prepare a suitable site for volcano.
  3.	Pour 4-5 spoons of sand in a hill-like shape on a fire-proof surface.
  4.	Make a socket on the top the sand hill.
  5.	Weight out equal amounts of iron powder and potassium nitrate. Mix the components thoroughly.
  6.	Place the mixture into the socket.
  7.	It is hard to ignite an iron-potassium nitrate mixture. It could stand the action of a burner flame for a while. One of the ways to overcome this difficulty is using red-hot coal. Heat the piece of coal with a gas burner till it becomes red-hot. Put the coal on top of the reagents mixture.
  8.	The active burning begins. The release of gold sparks and white smoke is observed. The substances are heated to a bright-yellow color and resemble lava.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
  There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
  Make sure there is nothing flammable nearby.
science_background: |
  Iron powder is oxidized by potassium nitrate. Potassium nitrate in this experiment works as source of oxygen. The Mixture of the components reacts forming potassium ferrate and nitrogen monoxide. The Reaction is highly exothermic and is accompanied with the evolution of a large amount of heat, sparks and smoke.
