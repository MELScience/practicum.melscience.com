step_by_step: |
  1.	Prepare a solution of potassium thiocyanate (KCNS) and a solutionof iron (III) chloride (FeCl3)
  2.	Moisten your hand with the solution of potassium thiocyanate
  3.	Wait until your hand dries a little
  4.	Soak a blunt knife or scissors in the iron (III) chloride solution
  5.	Touch the fake weapon with your hand. When potassium thiocyanate and iron (III) chloride come into contact they react producing a dark red liquid that looks like blood. 
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles.
science_background: |
   The reaction between potassium thiocyanate (KCNS) and iron (III) chloride (FeCl3) leads to the formation of a soluble iron (III)  thiocyanate (Fe(CNS)3) complex:
   FeCl3 + 3KCNS --> Fe(CNS)3 + 3KCl
   This compound has a dark red color and resembles blood.
