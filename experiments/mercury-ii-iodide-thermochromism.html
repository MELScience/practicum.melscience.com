step_by_step: |
  1.	Fill the test tube with mercury (II) iodide. Mercury (II) iodide could be obtained by mixing mercury chloride solution with potassium iodide solution. They form the precipitate of mercury (II) iodide which could be separated from the solution by filtration.
  2.	Put the test tube with mercury (II) iodide on a stand.
  3.	Heat the test tube with a gas burner.
  4.	The substance changes color from orangeâ€“red to pale yellow.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves. Mercury compounds are extremely toxic. Avoid body tissue contact with it.
science_background: |
  At 126<sup>o</sup> C mercury (II) iodide undergoes phase transition between red-orange alpha and pale yellow beta crystalline forms. Such an ability of a substance to change its color with temperature change is called thermochromism.
