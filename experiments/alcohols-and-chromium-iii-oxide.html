    language: ru
step_by_step: |
  1. Pour some alcohol into an evaporation dish.
  2. Put chromium (III) oxide into the dish.
  3. Ignite this mixture. Initially alcohol burns with a weak flame, but when chromium (III) oxide becomes red-hot, the flame intensifies and spreads.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
  There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready. Make sure there is nothing flammable nearby.
science_background: |
  Alcohols are flammable substances. The oxidation reaction may be catalyzed by chromium (III) oxide. Aldehydes are formed in this reaction.
