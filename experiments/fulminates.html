step_by_step: |
  1. Pour 7 mL of concentrated nitric acid into a test tube.
  2. Add 7 g of mercury into the test tube.
  3. After about 20 minutes, the mercury should be completely dissolved. The solution, thus, becomes yellow.
  4. Pour 10 ml of ethanol in a vial.
  5. Pour the contents of the test tube into the vial.
  6. After a while, the solution should boil. The reaction is complete after the boiling stops.
  7. Dilute the resulting mixture with water. Wait for the precipitate to settle down.
  8. Wash the precipitate with water several times.
  9. Transfer the substance together with the water into the container for storage.
  10. Take a small portion of the substance, dry it on paper, then, hit it with a hammer.
  11. Observe the explosion.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Use gloves. Nitrogen oxides are poisonous gases! Perform the reaction in a hood or outdoors. Work away from flammable objects.
science_background: |
  Fulminates have a very unusual structure. A metal binds to the acid anion is through  the carbon atom unlike the same situation with cyanates and isocyanates, bounding in which occurs through oxygen or nitrogen. Such molecules have positively and negatively charged fragments. For this reason, mercury fulminate is very unstable and explodes from external influences.
