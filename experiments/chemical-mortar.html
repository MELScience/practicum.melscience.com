step_by_step: |
  1. Fix a test tube to a stand at an angle of 45 degrees.
  2. Pour 3 g of potassium permanganate into the test tube.
  3. Add 5 ml of sulfuric acid to potassium permanganate. The liquid should be colored in dark-green color.
  4. Slowly, one by one, throw small paper balls into the test tube.
  5. Observe the flash, bangs and smoke emission.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Use gloves. Openong of the tube should be directed away from the experimenter and viewers
science_background: |
  Sulfuric acid is a strong acid. Therefore, manganese acid forms from potassium permanganate by reacting with sulfuric acid. At the same time, sulfuric acid is a highly effective dehydrating agent. Thus, the reaction proceeds with manganese oxide formation.
  Manganese oxide (VII) and manganese acid are strong oxidants decomposition of which leads to the formation of atomic oxygen and ozone.
  Cellulose is ignited in contact with the atomic oxygen and ozone. Some other organic substances behave similarly.
