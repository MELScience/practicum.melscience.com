step_by_step: |
  1. Pour 0.5 gram of sodium azide to a test tube.
  2. Close the test tube with a stopper with a tap and fix it in a stand.
  3. The other end of the hose must be connected to a flask fitted with a stopper with a double tap.
  4. Fill a graduated cylinder with water and place it in an aquarium with water upside down.
  5. Connect the hose from the flask to the cylinder.
  6. Heat the sodium azide, using a gas burner.
  7. Observe how the cylinder fills with a large amount of gas.

  Wear eye protection goggles.
science_background: |
  Sodium azide is a salt of hydrazoic acid. This compound is very unstable and quickly decomposes under external influence to simple substances. Sodium azide contains a large amount of nitrogen. 1 mole of sodium azide may release 1.5 mole of nitrogen.
  This reaction is used in airbags.
