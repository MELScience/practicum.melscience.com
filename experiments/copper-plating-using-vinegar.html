step_by_step: |
  1. Pour about 50 - 100 ml of vinegar into a beaker.
  2. Connect a copper wire or stripe and a metal item (spoon, nail, key or someone else) to a DC power supply (5V) using wires. Copper should be connected to the positive terminal, and the item - to the negative terminal of the power supply.
  3. Secure the copper electrode and the metal item in the beaker. Make sure, that the electrodes don't touch.
  4. After about 15 minutes remove the metal item from the solution. A layer of copper is formed on the metal surface.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
science_background: |
  Copper dissolves in the solution forming Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions under the action of an electric current. Reduction of copper ions occurs on the surface of the metal items. Thus the copper layer is formed on the metal surface.
  Vinegar solution becomes blue because of the presence of copper ions.
