step_by_step: |
  1. Take 2 g of solid copper(II) chloride and dissolve it in 10 ml of water in a 150 ml heat resistant beaker. Now you have a blue solution.
  2. Add a small amount of concentrated hydrochloric acid to the beaker. Now you have a yellow-green solution.
  3. Add water to the beaker to make the solution light-blue.
  4. Add a small amount of hydrochloric acid to make the solution green.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Be careful with the concentrated acid! 
science_background: |
  The two different colored Cu(II) complex ions, (Cu(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>)<sup>2+</sup> and (CuCl<sub>4</sub>)<sup>2-</sup>, exist together in equilibrium in the solution in the presence of chloride ions.
  (Cu(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>)<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)(blue)</sub> + 4Cl<sup>-</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> <--> (CuCl<sub>4</sub>)<sup>2-</sup><sub>(aq)(green)</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O.
  Chemical equilibrium behaves according to the Le Chatelierâ€™s principle. It can be stated as "When a system at equilibrium is subjected to change in concentration, temperature, volume, or pressure, then the system readjusts itself to (partially) counteract the effect of the applied change and a new equilibrium is established."
  In this experiment, when we add hydrochloric acid to solution, the equilibrium shifts to the right to compensate for the excess of chloride ions. The result is the formation of (CuCl<sub>4</sub>)<sup>2-</sup>. When we add water, the equilibrium shifts to the left and the result is (Cu(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>)<sup>2+</sup>. These two complexes have different colors because they have different geometries and different ligands around cobalt ion.
