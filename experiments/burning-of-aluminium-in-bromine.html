step_by_step: |
  1.	Since bromine is a highly volatile hazardous liquid, this experiment must be performed only in a fume hood.
  2.	Prepare the test tube. Put the stand into the fume hood.
  3.	Put the test tube on the stand.
  4.	Fill the test tube with bromine.
  5.	Place the foil into the test tube.
  6.	Wait a little. 
  7.	Aluminum reacts with bromine producing a flame. 
safety_description: |
   This experiment must be performed only outside or in a fume hood. Wear eye protection goggles and gloves.
science_background: |
  In this experiment aluminum is oxidized by bromine. This reaction is highly exothermic and is accompanied by flame and formation of aluminum bromide:
  2Al + 3Br2 --> 2AlBr3
  There is a small lag time before the reaction starts. The reason of is the presence of an oxide protection layer on the surface of the foil. It takes some time to break it down.
