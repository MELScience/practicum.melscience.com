step_by_step: |
  1. Pour some water into a beaker.
  2. Add salt (not iodized) to prepare a very concentrated sodium chloride solution.
  3. Secure two graphite electrodes connected to a power supply.
  4. Switch on the power supply. Electrolysis should gone on for several  hours.
  5. Evaporate the obtained solution to precipitate sodium hydroxide.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
  Follow the safety instructions when dealing with electricity.
science_background: |
  Sodium is an active metal, and in order to reactivity series hydrogen produces on the cathode in the electrolysis process. Thus, water undergoes electrolysis on the cathode, hydrogen and OH<sup>-</sup> ions are formed.
  Chlorine is produced on the anode. Because of this the experiment should be performed in a well-ventilated room.
  As a result of the electrolysis process sodium hydroxide is formed in the solution. It may be precipitated with boiling down the solution.
