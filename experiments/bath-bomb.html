step_by_step: |
  1.	It is easy to make your own bath bomb at home. The ingredients you need to prepare are: baking soda, citric acid, olive and essential oil, food coloring and table salt (sodium chloride). To increase the size of the bath bomb you can additionally use some corn starch.
  2.	Mix solid components in the following proportions: 2 cups of baking soda + 1 cup of citric acid + 0.5 cup of salt.
  3.	Mix them carefully in a large bowl.
  4.	Place two tea spoons of olive oil into a beaker or test tube.
  5.	Add some essential oil and few drops of food coloring into the beaker (test tube).Close the vessel and shake it to mix the oils and food coloring.
  6.	Join the liquid and solid components together. Slowly add liquid to the solid and mix them with a spatula. 
  7.	Mold the obtained mass into desired shape.
  8.	Let the bath bomb dry.
  9.	Put it into water.
  10.	A lot of bubbles are produced!

science_background: |
  The reason why the bath bomb fizzes in water is the chemical reaction between citric acid and baking soda. This reaction does not begin when chemicals are dry. To set up the reaction the addition of water is required. It dissolves solid components and let the ions to exchange and collide much more easily. As a result sodium citrate, water and carbon dioxide are produced. The evaluated CO<sub>2</sub> makes the solution fizz.
