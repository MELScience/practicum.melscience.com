step_by_step: |
  1.	In order to prepare invisible inks you need the following reagents: thymolphthalein, ethanol, 3 molar sodium hydroxide solution.
  2.	Dissolve 0.1 gram of thymolphthalein in 10 ml of ethanol.
  3.	Add 90 ml of water and stir the solution. It will be milky-white.
  4.	Using a pipette pour about 1 ml of sodium hydroxide solution to the thymolphthalein solution.
  5.	The obtained mixture is an invisible ink. If it gets on your clothes or table it will disappear within a few minutes.

science_background: |
  Thymolphthalein is an acid-base indicator. It changes color depending on solution pH. In neutral and acidic solutions it is colorless. In alkaline solution it turns dark-blue. pH of invisible inks is alkaline because of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) presence and it is the reason of the dark-blue color of the mixture. When the ink comes in contact with air, sodium hydroxide interacts with carbon dioxide:
  2NaOH + CO<sub>2</sub> --> Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O
  This reaction leads to pH change. The acidity of the solution increases and thymolphtaleine becomes colorless.
