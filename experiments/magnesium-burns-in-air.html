    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Take 6-8 cm of magnesium ribbon with tweezers.
  2. Ignite the ribbon with a burner. The ribbon burns with a white flame.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
  Don't look directly at the flame.
science_background: |
  Magnesium reacts with oxygen from air and forms magnesium oxide. This reaction is very exothermic, but to initiate the reaction ignition is needed. The flame has a bright white color - it is the characteristic color of magnesium flame. A white powder of magnesium oxide forms in this experiment.
  In this process magnesium also reacts with carbon dioxide CO<sub>2</sub>  forming carbon and magnesium oxide.
