title_name: Lead iodide in a Petri dish
descriptive_name: Two solid salts are put in the opposite sides of the Petri dish, and a yellow front arises in the solution
scientific_name: Due to the diffusion of lead cations and iodide anions in the liquid, yellow precipitate of lead iodide is formed when ions react

step_by_step: |
  1. Fill a Petri dish with water.
  2. Accurately place some crystals of lead nitrate at one side of this dish.
  3. Accurately place some crystals of potassium iodide at the other side of the Petri dish.
  4. The yellow streak will appears near the center of the Petri dish.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection
  Lead nitrate and potassium iodide are toxic.
  Avoid contact of lead nitrate with the skin.
science_background: |
  When  lead nitrate and  potassium iodide dissolve in water, ions produced by them diffuse in the liquid.
  Yellow precipitate of lead iodide is formed, when lead cations and iodide anions meet together.
