    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Prepare a set of water solutions of sodium tetraborate decahydrate of different concentrations. You can do this by a serial dilution of a known initial concentration solution. Place these solutions in wells of the test-plate.
  2. Dissolve some curcumin in ethanol.
  3. Add 3 drops in each of the wells.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection and lab gloves.
science_background: |
  Boron from boric acid ions forms a red complex called rosocyanine with curcumin. In this complex one atom of boron coordinates with two molecules of curcumin. The color of the obtained solution depends on the concentration of boron. This reaction may be used for detecting boron in water samples during ecology monitoring.
