step_by_step: |
  1.	Since sulfur dioxide is a hazardous gas, this experiment must be performed only outside or in a fume hood.
  2.	Prepare a hermetically sealed flask and long deflagrating spoon.
  3.	Fill the flask with oxygen.
  4.	Fill the spoon with sulfur.
  5.	Heat the spoon with a gas burner in order to facilitate sulfur ignition.
  6.	Put the spoon into the flask.
  7.	Sulfur burns with a blue flame producing sulfur dioxide.

  This experiment must be performed only outside or in a fume hood. Wear eye protection goggles and gloves. 
science_background: |
  Combustion of sulfur in pure oxygen is a very beautiful process. It burns with a brilliant blue flame. The main product of the reaction is sulfur dioxide:
  S + O2 --> SO2
