step_by_step: |
  1. Put a few grams of copper sulfate pentahydrate into a test-tube. Secure obliquely this test-tube with a clamp.
  2. Close the test-tube with a stopper with a delivery tube. put The end of the delivery tube in the second test-tube. The second test-tube should be placed in a cold water bath (beaker filled with cold water).
  3. Heat the test-tube with a burner. Move the flame time-to-time to heat the whole test-tube and avoid condensation of the water vapours.
  4. Copper sulfate turns from blue to white. Water from the hydrate collects in the second test-tube.
  5. After the whole copper sulfate sample becomes white, stop heating. Slowly add collected water to the obtained anhydrous copper sulfate, it turns blue again.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
science_background: |
  Copper sulfate pentahydrate CuSO<sub>4</sub>*5H<sub>2</sub>O is a blue colored substance. When heated it turns to pale blue copper trihydrate CuSO<sub>4</sub>*3H<sub>2</sub>O, and then to white copper monohydrate CuSO<sub>4</sub>*H<sub>2</sub>O. After the heating is over 250 C all molecules of water are removed. After the addition of water, copper sulfate hydrates are formed again.
