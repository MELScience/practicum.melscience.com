step_by_step: |
  1. Take 4 g of solid cobalt(II) chloride-6-water and dissolve it in 40 ml of water in a 250 ml heat resistant beaker. You have a light pink solution.
  2. Put the beaker on a magnetic mixer, dip a stir bar into the solution and turn on the mixing and heating.
  3. Add about 60 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid to the beaker. You have a violet or blue solution. The color of the mixture depends on the ration between the acid and cobalt(II) chloride.
  4. Add a small amount of water to the beaker to make the solution pink.
  5. Add a small amount of hydrochloric acid to the beaker to make the solution blue.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Be careful with the concentrated acid! Don't drink or eat cobalt compounds and cobalt-containing solutions, they are very toxic!
science_background: |
  The two different colored Co(II) complex ions, [Co(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> and [CoCl<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>, exist together in equilibrium in the solution in the presence of chloride ions:
  (Co(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>)<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)(pink)</sub> + 4Cl<sup>-</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> <--> (CoCl<sub>4</sub>)<sup>2-</sup><sub>(aq)(blue)</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O
