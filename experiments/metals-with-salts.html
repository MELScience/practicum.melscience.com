step_by_step: |
  1. Prepare a saturated solution of copper sulphate and to divide it into two parts, poured into two round bottom flasks.
  2. Put a few granules of zinc into the first flask.
  3. Place several steel pushpins into the second flask.
  4. Leave the flasks for a few hours.
  5. Observe the change of the color of the solutions and precipitation of copper on the surface of metals.
  6. For the reaction to proceed better, the solutions may be heated or acidified.

  Wear eye protection goggles.
science_background: |
  Different metals have different standard electrochemical potentials. Depending on this, a metal has a particular position in the electrochemical series. Metals, that are left, are more active than metals situated in the right part of the series. More active displace (can reduce) less active metals from solutions of their salts.
