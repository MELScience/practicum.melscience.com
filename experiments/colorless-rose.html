step_by_step: |
  1.	This experiment should be performed only in a fume hood.
  2.	Prepare a flask, chlorine source and a red rose.
  3.	Attach one end of the gas delivery tube to the chlorine source. Put the other one down the flask.
  4.	Fill the flask with chlorine. 
  5.	Place the rose into the flask. Cover the flask neck with a watch glass.
  6.	After a while take out the flower. The rose turns white.
safety_description: |
  Chlorine is a very toxic gas. Perform this experiment only in a fume hood. Wear eye protection goggles and gloves.
science_background: |
  Anthocyanins are common pigments of many flowers. The red color of rose petals is caused by their presence. Chlorine is a strong oxidizer. It easily reacts with plenty of pigments and is usually used as a bleaching agent. Anthocyanins are reduced and turn the rose white.
