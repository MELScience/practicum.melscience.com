step_by_step: |
  1. Obtain chlorine gas. There are many different ways, one of which is shown in the first link.
  2. Collect chlorine gas into a chemical cylinder.
  3. Heat the iron wire (or iron wool) over a gas burner or alcohol lamp.
  4. Quickly add the glowing hot wire into the cylinder with chlorine.
  5. Watch the cylinder fill with yellow-brown smoke.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Work with poisonous gases only outdoors or in a hood.
science_background: |
  Chlorine gas is a strong oxidant. Metallic iron is oxidized to ferric chloride, which forms the smoke. The reaction takes place at the interface very slowly, so heating is necessary.
