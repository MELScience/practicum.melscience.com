    title: How to Make a Smoke Bomb with Sugar and Potassium Nitrate
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1.	To prepare a smoke bomb you need potassium nitrate and sugar (or sorbitol, glucose). The result mixture should contain 3 parts of potassium nitrate and 2 parts of sugar. Weight out the components and mix them in given proportion.
  2.	Place a metal bowl on an oil bath.
  3.	Pour reagents into the bowl.
  4.	Heat the mixture gently. Stir it using a wooden spoon. Keep on heating and stirring until the mixture turns to a caramel-like mass.
  5.	Turn off heating. Put the mass with a wooden spoon on top of aluminum foil.
  6.	Place a piece of magnesium ribbon as a fuse.
  7.	Mold the mass into desired shape using aluminum foil as a wrap.
  8.	After a while the mass will cool down and become hard. Put off the foil. The smoke bomb is ready for use.
  9.	Set the smoke bomb in a safe place away from any flammable material. Light the ribbon and stand back.
  10.	The smoke bomb produces some flame and a huge amount of smoke.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves during preparation process. In order to avoid self ignition do not use open flame to melt the ingredients. There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
  Make sure there is nothing flammable nearby. Test the smoke bomb outdoors only. Avoid of inhalation of the reaction products.
science_background: |
  The smoke bomb used in this experiment consists of two main components: sugar as a fuel and potassium nitrate as an oxidizer. The mixture burns rapidly with release of a large quantity of expanding gases. Potassium nitrate decomposes producing oxygen to oxidize the fuel.
