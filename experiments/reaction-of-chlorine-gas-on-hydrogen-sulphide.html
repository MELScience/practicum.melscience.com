step_by_step: |
  1.	This experiment should be performed only in a fume hood.
  2.	Prepare the solution of hydrochloric acid, the solution of sodium sulfide and a chlorine gas source.
  3.	Pour the solution of hydrochloric acid into the jar.
  4.	Fill the jar with chlorine gas and cover it with a watch glass.
  5.	Add the solution of sodium sulfide to the jar.
  6.	The released hydrogen sulfide gas reacts with chlorine producing a yellow precipitate of elemental sulfur.
safety_description: |
  This experiment should be performed in a fume hood or outdoors. Wear eye protection goggles and gloves.
science_background: |
  When sodium sulfide solution is mixed with hydrochloric acid the components reacts forming sodium chloride and hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide is a colorless gas with a characteristic smell of rotten eggs. Chlorine oxidizes hydrogen sulfide giving sulfur and hydrochloric acid. Sulfur is insoluble in water and precipitates on the jar walls. If chlorine is in excess sulfur chlorides also could be produced. This reaction of chlorine (in form of sodium hypochlorite as a rule) and hydrogen sulfide  is used to remove hydrogen sulfide from drinking water.
