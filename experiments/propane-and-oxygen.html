step_by_step: |
  1. Fill the balloon with propane.
  2. For a more powerful explosion, oxygen may be pumped from the cylinder. Also, oxygen can obtained in a variety of other ways.
  3. Hold the balloon to a source of fire, while being at a long distance.
  4. Watch the explosion of propane.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Ears protection. You need to be at a long distance from the ballon.
science_background: |
  Propane as an alkane, burns well in oxygen. Thus, a large amount of heat is produced. An explosion occurs at significant concentrations of propane.
