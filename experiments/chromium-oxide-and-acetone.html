step_by_step: |
  1. Put 1 gram of chromium oxide in a mortar using a spatula.
  2. Then, pour a few milliliters of acetone.
  3. Ignite the acetone using matches or a lighter. Quickly move away.
  4. Watch intense burning or explosion of the reaction mixture
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Use a fire-resistant workplace. If possible, use a hood or carry out the experiment outdoors.
science_background: |
  Chromium oxide is an unstable compound and a very strong oxidizing agent. Decomposition of chromium trioxide leads to the formation of chromium oxide(III) and oxygen under the action of heat generated by the combustion of acetone. Oxygen, in turn, supports the combustion of acetone, making it more intense, ultimately leading to an explosion.
