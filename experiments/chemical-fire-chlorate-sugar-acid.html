    title: Potassium chlorate. Part 2
    language: rus
step_by_step: |
  1. Take a small amount of potassium chlorate and grind it in the ceramic pounder. You should use clean and dry instruments.
  2. Take a small amount of sugar or glucose and grind it in the other ceramic pounder. Use 2 different pounders! Or you can take powdered sugar or starch from your kitchen.
  3. Mix potassium chlorate and sugar in ratio 1:1.
  4. Put the mixture on the refractory plate and form a pile with a pit from it.
  5. Take a glass rod and touch the concentrated solution of sulfuric acid with the end of the rod. Be careful with sulfuric acid!
  6. Touch the pit in the mixture with the end of the rod. Keep a safe distance! It is a very rough, hot and loud reaction. Be careful and keep calm!
safety_description: |
  Be careful with concentrated sulfuric acid and use protective goggles. It is a very rough, hot and loud reaction. Keep a safe distance. Be careful and keep calm! There is a fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
science_background: |
  Potassium chlorate is a very effective oxidizer. Sugar (or glucose) is a redusing agent in this experiment. Sulfuric acid is a catalyst of the interaction of potassium chlorate and a redusing agent:
  8KClO<sub>3</sub> + C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub> -[H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>]-> 8KCl + 12CO<sub>2</sub> + 11H<sub>2</sub>O
  It is a very rough, loud and exothermic reaction.
