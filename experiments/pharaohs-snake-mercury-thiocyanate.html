step_by_step: |
  1. To perform this experiment you need only one reagent - mercury thiocyanate.
  2. Since mercury thiocyanate and products of its decomposing are extremely toxic this experiment must performed only in a fume hood.
  3. Put some mercury thiocyanate on a non-combustible surface.
  4. Light up the kindling.
  5. Ignite the mercury thiocyanate .
safety_description: |
   Since mercury thiocyanate and products of its decomposing are extremely toxic this experiment must performed only in a fume hood. Wear lab gloves and eye protection.There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
science_background: |
  The pharaoh snake is a solid-like substance consisting of mercury thiocyanate decomposition products. When a solid tablet of mercury thiocyanate is exposed to heat it burns with a blue flame. The decomposition reaction looks as follows:
  Hg(SCN)<sub>2</sub> --> 2HgS + CS<sub>2</sub> + C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>
  The first two products can react with oxygen of air:
  CS<sub>2</sub> + 3O<sub>2</sub> --> CO<sub>2</sub> + 2SO<sub>2</sub>
  HgS + O<sub>2</sub> --> Hg + SO<sub>2</sub>
  Dicyan breaks down under heating:
  2C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> --> 3(CN)<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>
