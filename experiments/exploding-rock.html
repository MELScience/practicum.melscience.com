    title: A Study of the Reaction Between Calcium Oxide and Water
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1.	Put a piece of solid calcium oxide into the beaker. Calcium oxide could be obtained by heating of calcium carbonate or calcium carbonate containing materials such as limestone or seashells.
  2.	For a more impressive (but more dangerous!) demonstration take a large piece of calcium oxide the size of a rock. Put it into a tray and cover with a safety screen.
  3.	Pour some water on calcium oxide surface.
  4.	Steam is generated. Calcium oxide reacts with water so vigorously that our rock explodes. 
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves. Use safety screen for demonstration.
science_background: |
  Calcium oxide (or quicklime) is a white solid substance. If it is pressed in a large piece it looks like a rock. It could be obtained by thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate. Heating calcium carbonate it is possible to drive out carbon dioxide leaving behind calcium oxide. Chemical properties of quicklime are typical for basic oxides. It reacts with water vigorously producing calcium hydroxide. This reaction is very exothermic. The released heat is causing the rock to crack in smaller pieces. The steam is produced by the excess of water which evaporates under increasing temperature.
