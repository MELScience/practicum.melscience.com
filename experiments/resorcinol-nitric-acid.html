step_by_step: |
  1. Preparation of anhydrous nitric acid. Mix 25 ml of concentrated nitric acid and 10 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid in a round bottom flask. Assemble the system for distillation. Distill nitric acid.
  2. Pour 10 ml of anhydrous nitric acid in a 50 ml beaker.
  3. Add a small amount of resorcinol.
  4. Observe a violent reaction with the release of brown fumes.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Use gloves. NO2 is a poisonous gas! Work with poisonous gases only outdoors or in a hood.
science_background: |
  Concentrated nitric acid is a strong oxidizing agent. Unlike regular acids which have oxidizing properties due to the presence a hydrogen cation in their molecule, a molecule of nitric acid has a nitrogen atom in oxidation state +5, which gives very strong oxidizing properties.
  Anhydrous nitric acid can easily react with organic compounds. It is impossible to buy, because it is very unstable. Therefore, it's necessary to be obtained.
  The resulting nitroresorcinol further reacts with resorcinol leading to the formation of resazurin (redox indicator).
  Fumes of the solution are composed of NO2 (brown gas).
