step_by_step: |
  1. Pour 10 g of sodium polyacrylate in a beaker.
  2. Add 90 ml of water into the beaker.
  3. Observe the complete absorption of the water and a dramatic increase in the volume of powder.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles.
science_background: |
  Sodium polyacrylate is an anionic polyelectrolyte with a negatively charged carboxyl group in the main chain. One of its main features is the ability to absorb liquid in 200-300 times more than its own weight. The substance is widely used in the production of consumer goods.
