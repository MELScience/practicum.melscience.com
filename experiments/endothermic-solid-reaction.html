step_by_step: |
  1. Place 32 g of barium hydroxide-8-water into a beaker.
  2. Add 10 g of ammonium chloride into the beaker.
  3. Stir the resulting mixture.
  4. Pipette a few drops of water on a small wooden plaque. Put the beaker on it.
  5. Raise the beaker. The plaque should stick to it. It is also possible to measure the temperature of the reaction mixture. It should be about -25 degrees Celsius.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles.
science_background: |
  During this reaction, the two solids form a liquid and a gas. Based on this fact, it can be assumed that the change in entropy in this case will be positive, and will help the reaction to proceed. Thus, the temperature of the reaction can be positive or negative.
  The thermal effect of the reaction can be calculated based on the standard enthalpies of formation of the materials. Depending on the assumptions about the product (BaCl<sub>2</sub> or BaCl<sub>2</sub>*H<sub>2</sub>O), it is equal to 164 or 135 kJ / mol.
