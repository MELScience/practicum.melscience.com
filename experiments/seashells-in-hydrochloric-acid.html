step_by_step: |
  1.	Put a few seashells in a petri dish.
  2.	Pour hydrochloric acid on the bottom of the petri dish.
  3.	Acid dissolves the seashells.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves.
science_background: |
  Seashells consist of about 63-94% of calcium carbonate, 2-25% of silicon dioxide and small amount of other admixtures. Calcium carbonate easily reacts with hydrochloric acid with the formation of calcium chloride, water and carbon dioxide. 
  CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 2HCl --> CaCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub> 
  This reaction is highly exothermic. The released gas makes the seashells move. Silicon dioxide does not react with hydrochloric acid and remains unchanged.
