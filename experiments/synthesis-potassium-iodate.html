    title: The preparation of iodic acid and its anhydride
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Dissolve a small amount of potassium chlorate in water, using a flat-bottomed flask.
  2. Add several drops of concentrated nitric acid so that the pH of the solution becomes about two.
  3. Add a small amount of iodine.
  4. Heat the flask until all iodine dissolves, using a spirit lamp.
  5. Add a small amount of potassium hydroxide until the medium becomes basic.
  6. Filter the resulting mixture.
  7. Evaporate half of the water from the filtrate.
  8. Place the cup with the solution in a refrigerator.
  9. The white precipitate should fall. Decant the yellow solution above the precipitate.
  10. The resulting precipitate is potassium iodate.

  Wear eye protection goggles.
science_background: |
  There is a redox reaction. The reduction potential of the oxidizing agent is greater than the reduction potential of the reducing agent, so this process is possible. In addition, a plurality of side reactions occurs with the release of chlorine and nitrogen oxides, which explains the formation of precipitate in the first stage and the yellowing of the solution.
  The second stage is a common neutralization reaction.
  Potassium iodate has a lower solubility than impurities, and therefore can be isolated by crystallization from a cold solution.
