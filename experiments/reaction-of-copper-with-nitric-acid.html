step_by_step: |
  1.	Prepare a round-bottomed flask with thick walls, a conic flask and a gas delivery tube.
  2.	Fill the round-bottomed flask with concentrated nitric acid.
  3.	Pour water into the conic flask.
  4.	Connect the vessels with a gas delivery tube. The end of the tube should touch the bottom of the conic flask.
  5.	Put glass wool to the neck of the conic flask.
  6.	Add the copper to the round-bottomed flask. Close it with a rubber stopper with a gas delivery tube.
  7.	The solution turns green. The production of a brown gas is observed. When the reaction slows down and the gas is almost released, pressure in the system decreases. This leads to the water pouring back into the round-bottom flask. The brown gas dissolves.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves. Concentrated nitric acid is corrosive and oxidising and should be handled with care. Nitrogen dioxide is toxic. Avoid its diffusion to air.Perform this experiment in a well ventilated room.
science_background: |
  This experiment demonstrates the reaction between copper and nitric acid:
  Cu + 4HNO<sub>3</sub> --> Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2NO<sub>2</sub> +H<sub>2</sub>O
  At the first stage when copper reacts with concentrated nitric acid the metal ion coordinates with nitrate ions. This complex gives green color to the solution. The brown gas produced in the reaction is nitrogen dioxide. When water is added the solution becomes blue since nitrate ions are replaced by water molecules from the copper coordination shell. Nitrogen dioxide dissolves in the solution.
