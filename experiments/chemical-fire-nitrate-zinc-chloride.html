step_by_step: |  
  1. Take a refractory plate and place a small piece of paper in the center of it.
  2. Prepare a mixture of 4 g of ammonium nitrate and 1 g of sodium chloride. All components must be thoroughly ground.
  3. Put the mixture of ammonium nitrate and sodium chloride on the piece of paper on the plate.
  4. Add thereto 10 g of zinc powder or zinc shavings. Mix the components.
  5. To start the reaction, add a few drops of water.
safety_description: |
  Use protective goggles and keep a safe distance.There is a fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
science_background: |
  Ammonium nitrate is an effective oxidizer, zinc is a reducing agent. But nothing happens if we mix these substances. However, if we add sodium chloride to the ammonium nitrate and add water, the following  catalytic decomposition reaction will begin:
  NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> -[Cl<sup>-</sup>]-> N<sub>2</sub>O + 2H<sub>2</sub>O 
  Here Cl<sup>-</sup>-ions are catalysts of the decomposition reaction. The addition of water is very important. The decomposition reaction is exothermic, i.e. the mixture is heated in the reaction. Upon heating the remaining ammonium nitrate melts and melted ammonium nitrate reacts with zinc:
  Zn + NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> --> N<sub>2</sub> + ZnO + 2H<sub>2</sub>O
  This reaction is very exothermic too. As a result, the paper ignites.
