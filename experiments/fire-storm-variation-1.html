step_by_step: |
  1. You may use a concentrated ammonia solution or prepare ammonia gas by yourself. To prepare ammonia gas put sodium hydroxide and ammonia nitrate into a flask (in the ratio 1:1). Add a little water to the flask to initiate the reaction, and close it with a stopper with a gas-vent. Collect the produced ammonia into an inverted 1l flask (ammonia gas is lighter than air). After this close the flask filled with ammonia with a stopper. If you use ammonia solution, just pour about 100 ml of the solution into the flask and close it with a stopper.
  2. Make a crucible with a long metal handle (like a ladle). Put about 10 g of ammonium dichromate into the crucible. 
  3. Heat the crucible above a burner.
  4. When ammonium dichromate starts to decompose forming  ammonium (III) oxide, lower  the crucible into to the flask with ammonium. Many sparks of fire occur in the flask after this.
  You also may heat purchasable chromium (III) oxide and spray it in the flask with ammonia.
safety_description: |
  Wear goggles and gloves.
  This experiment must be performed only in a fume hood.
science_background: |
  Ammonium dichromate decomposes under heating producing  chromium (III) oxide. Hot pieces of chromium (III) oxide are scattered sideways. It catalyzes the oxidation of ammonia with oxygen from air. In this reaction nitrogen oxide is produced, and then it is oxidized to nitrogen dioxide (a reddish-brown gas).
