    title: How to make nitrocellulose (guncotton)
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Make a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids. Put 50 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid and 25 ml of concentrated nitric acid into a graduated cylinder.
  2. Transfer the mixture into a beaker and stir.
  3. Weigh approximately 5 grams of cotton wool.
  4. Put the cotton wool into a beaker and stir the resulting mixture. Wait until the brown gas stops releasing (approximately 2 minutes).
  5. Prepare 3 beakers with distilled water.
  6. Transfer the cotton wool from the beaker with acids into the first beaker with water, then to the second beaker, then to the third beaker.
  7. Wait 15 minutes.
  8. Add a small amount of soda to the third beaker until the gas stops releasing.
  9. Rinse the cotton wool with water and dry it.
  10. Ignite the resulting piece of nitrocellulose. It will burn very quickly.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Work away from flammable objects.
science_background: |
  Cotton wool consists of cellulose. Cellulose is a carbohydrate, and thus exposed to nitration reaction.
  Like all nitro compounds, nitrocellulose has a low stability, and therefore burns very quickly.
