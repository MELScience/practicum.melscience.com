step_by_step: |
  1.	Put some organic matter for example rice krispies into a fire-proof beaker.
  2.	Sprinkle the rice krispies with sodium peroxide powder. 
  3.	Add a few drops of water. The rice krispies burn rapidly!
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves. There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
  Make sure there is nothing flammable nearby.
science_background: |
  Sodium peroxide contains two oxygen atoms still joined together like in an oxygen molecule. These two atoms make the molecule rather reactive. It readily decomposes in water. During sodium peroxide decomposition a lot of molecular oxygen is released. If there is some organic matter in the reaction area it is oxidized with oxygen and burns.
