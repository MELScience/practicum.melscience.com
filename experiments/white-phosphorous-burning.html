step_by_step: |
  1.	This experiment must be performed only in a fume hood.
  2.	Prepare a round bottom flask.
  3.	Fill it with an inert material to prevent overheating of the flask. Sand is a suitable material for this purpose.
  4.	Add O2 gas to the flask.
  5.	Put a small amount of white phosphorus into the flask.
  6.	Heat the steel rod.
  7.	The ignition temperature of phosphorous is 34oC.  To heat it touch the piece of phosphorous with a hot steel rod.
  8.	White phosphorous starts burning forming phosphorus oxide vapor. 
safety_description: |
  White phosphorus and its oxides are extremely toxic. Be very careful to not get phosphorus on the skin! Avoid inhaling the smoke. Wear eye protection goggles and gloves. This experiment must be performed only in a fume hood.
science_background: |
  White phosphorus is a very reactive substance. The molecule consists of four atoms, connected together with high energy bonds into a tetrahedral structure. It easily combines with oxygen forming phosphorus (V) oxide:
  P4 + 5O2 --> P4O10
