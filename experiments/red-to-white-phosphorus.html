    title: An illustrated guide on the preparation of white phosphorus (P4) from red phosphorus (P)
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Place a small amount of red phosphorus into the U-tube.
  2. Heat the red phosphorus using a gas burner. Vapours of white phosphorus must move to the second knee of the tube and condense in the form of an orange solid.
  3. Remove the resulting white phosphorus.
  4. Observe autoignition of white phosphorus.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Vapours of white phosphorus are poisonous! Perform the reaction in a hood or outdoors.
science_background: |
  There are several allotropic modifications of phosphorus. When heated, the structure of the crystal lattice of red phosphorus is changed. Thus, formation of white phosphorus occurs. The orange color of white phosphorus is caused by red phosphorus impurities.
  White phosphorus is much more chemically active and pyrophoric.
