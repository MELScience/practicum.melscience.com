    title: Instant Freeze â€“ Water Turns to Ice in a Flash
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Take a glass or plastic bowl.
  2. Put an ice cube in there and lower an end of a thread on it.
  3. Sprinkle salt on the ice cube.
  4. Wait 1 minute and lift the ice cube on the free end of the thread.

science_background: |
  When different substances dissolve, solution can be cooled or heated. This is due to the fact that ions move in a chaotic dissolved form from static crystalline form.
  And most salt solutions freeze at a different temperature than pure water. This is due to the fact that the crystallization energy of water and the crystallization energy of salt are different.
  Salt lowers the freezing point of water, the ice melts quickly. Water refreezes into ice and the surrounding thread and so the thread can be used to lift the ice cube out of the water.
