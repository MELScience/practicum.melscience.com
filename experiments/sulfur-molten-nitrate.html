step_by_step: |
  1. Pour 3 grams of potassium nitrate into a test tube.
  2. Fix the test tube on a stand.
  3. Melt potassium nitrate using a spirit lamp or a gas burner.
  4. Slowly add small pieces of sulfur.
  5. Observe a bright glowing. The test tube may begin to melt.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Work away from flammable objects in a hood or outdoors.
science_background: |
  Potassium nitrate is a common oxidizing agent which can reduce sulfur. Due to the fact that both of materials are solid, the reaction doesn't occur at room temperature, due to the small contact area between the reactants. Therefore, you need to melt the potassium nitrate. The reaction is very exothermic, so you can observe a bright glow.
