step_by_step: |
  1.	To obtain iron (II) hydroxide mix the solutions of iron (II) sulfate and potassium hydroxide in a flask
  2.	The green-gray precipitate is formed
  3.	To test the action of an acid on iron (II) hydroxide put a few drops of hydrochloric acid solution to the flask. The solution become yellow and clear
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves.
science_background: |
  Iron (II) sulfate reacts with potassium hydroxide producing iron (II) hydroxide and potassium sulfate. The exchange reaction between soluble salt and alkali is the common way to obtain insoluble hydroxides. The iron (II) sulfate under the action of alkali forms a green-gray precipitate. The addition of hydrochloric acid dissolves the precipitate turning iron (II) hydroxide back to iron (II) chloride.
