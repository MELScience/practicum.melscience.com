step_by_step: |
  1. Obtain chlorine gas. There are many different ways.
  2. Collect chlorine gas into a chemical cylinder.
  3. Heat the copper wire over a gas burner or alcohol lamp.
  4. Quickly add the glowing hot wire into the cylinder with chlorine.
  5. Watch the cylinder fill with yellow-green smoke and drops fall.
  6. You can add a little water into the cylinder at the beginning, to observe the formation of blue copper chloride solution
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Work with poisonous gases only outdoors or in a hood.
science_background: |
  Chlorine gas is a strong oxidant. Metallic copper is oxidized to copper chloride, which forms the smoke. The reaction takes place at the interface very slowly, so heating is necessary. Copper chloride is very hygroscopic, so there are falling drops of copper chloride.
