    title: Make "Sterno" Flaming Jelly from Antacid, Vinegar and Alcohol
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Crush some antacid tablets into a powder.
  2. Add 10 ml of vinegar per tablet to the powder.
  3. Allow the mixture to evaporate until the volume reduces by half.
  4. Mix obtained calcium acetate slurry with an alcohol (methanol, ethanol or isopropanol), stir it. A white jelly is formed.
  5. Put some of the formed gel onto an incombustible plate and ignite it.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection and lab gloves.
  Make sure there is nothing flammable near the ignited jelly.
  There is a fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
science_background: |
  Use an antacid which contain at least 1000 mg calcium carbonate per tablet for this experiment. Calcium carbonate reacts with vinegar (acetic acid) and forms calcium acetate. Calcium acetate is insoluble in alcohols, but soluble in water. When mixed, the saturated water solution of calcium acetate and the alcohol form the flammable jelly.
