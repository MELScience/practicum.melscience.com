step_by_step: |
  1. Place a small amount of silver oxide in a vial.
  2. Add a little aqueous ammonia in volume about 1.5 times greater than the volume of silver oxide.
  3. Stir the resulting mixture.
  4. Leave the mixture for 2 hours.
  5. Throw the vial from a great height onto the ground. Observe the explosion.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Use gloves. Perform the reaction in a hood or outdoors. Work away from flammable objects.
science_background: |
  Often, due to the fact that silver is a noble metal, its compounds are unstable. In particular, the covalent bond between silver and nitrogen is weaker than, for example, silver-oxygen ionic bond. Therefore, silver nitride is explosive.
