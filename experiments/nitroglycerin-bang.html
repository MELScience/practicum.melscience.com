    title: Why is nitroglycerin explosive?
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Put a piece of paper on an anvil.
  2. Very carefully put a few drops of nitroglycerin on the piece of paper.
  3. Strike the paper with a hammer. An explosion will occur.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection. There will be an explosion - keep a safe distance. 
science_background: |
  Nitroglycerin is a very unstable substance, and it can explode at strike or friction. Because of this it is very dangerous to store and to transport nitroglycerin.
