step_by_step: |
  1. Put some dimethylamine hydrochloride and sodium hydroxide into a test-tube.
  2. Pour some water into the-test tube. The dimethylamine gas evolves from the reaction mixture.
  3. Close the test-tube with a rubber stopper equipped with an outlet glass tube.
  4. Put a burner to the outlet tube to ignite the produced dimethylamine.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
  There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready. Make sure there is nothing flammable nearby.
  This experiment must be performed in a well-ventilated room or in a fume hood.
science_background: |
  Dimethylamine hydrochloride and sodium hydroxide react in water forming dimethylamine gas. It is a flammable gas which reacts with oxygen forming carbon dioxide, water and nitrogen.
