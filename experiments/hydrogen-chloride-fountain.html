step_by_step: |
  1. Obtain hydrogen chloride. Pour approximately 10 grams of sodium chloride into a flask and add 25 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid. Close the flask with a stopper equipped by a tap with a tube. Lower the other end of the tube into an empty liter flask. Hydrogen chloride is heavier than air, so the flask should be kept neck up while filling.
  2. Close the flask filled with hydrogen chloride.
  3. Fill a large evaporation dish with two liters of water.
  4. Dissolve a small amount of litmus in water.
  5. Replace the stopper of the flask with hydrogen chloride with a stopper equipped by tap with a tube.
  6. Attach the flask with hydrogen chloride on the stand upside down.
  7. Lower the other end of the tube into the evaporation dish with water.
  8. Observe the filling of the flask and the color change of the indicator from purple to red.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Use gloves. Hydrogen chloride is a poisonous gas! If possible, use a hood or carry out the experiment outdoors.
science_background: |
  Hydrogen chloride is highly soluble in water. Pressure drops in the flask when hydrogen chloride dissolves in water. Due to the pressure difference water starts to flow into the upper flask.The indicator changes color due to the change of the reaction medium from neutral to alkaline.
