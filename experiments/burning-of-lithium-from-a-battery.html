step_by_step: |
  1. Take a lithium battery, remove the plastic wrap, and open the metal case.
  2. Take out the inside part of the battery, unwind the rolled coated lithium foil, remove the warps.
  3. Place removed lithium into a beaker, filled with kerosene for storage.
  4. Take a piece of lithium with tweezers and place it on a metal plate. Blot off the kerosene using filter paper.
  5. Ignite the piece of lithium with a burner.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
  Lithium may explode, if it is ignited on a non-metal surface.
  There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
science_background: |
  Lithium is a very active metal. While burning it reacts with both oxygen and nitrogen from air. The flame has a red color - it is the characteristic color of a flame in presence of lithium ions.
