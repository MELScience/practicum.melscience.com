step_by_step: |
  1. Pour soapy water into a large beaker or a basin.
  2. Bubble propane-butane mixture (LGP) through soapy water.
  3. When enough foam is formed, ignite it with a burner. You may take some foam and ignite it on your hand.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab goggles and gloves.
  There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
  Make sure there is nothing flammable nearby.
science_background: |
  LPG mainly consists of propane and butane, and they are highly flammable substances. Soapy bubbles are filled with LGP and due to this the foam is flammable. When the foam is ignited on a hand, LPG burns quickly before it can burn a wet hand.
