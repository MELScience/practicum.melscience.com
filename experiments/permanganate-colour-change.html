step_by_step: |
  1. Prepare a solution of potassium permanganate, the concentration should be moderate so that the solution is slightly pink and moderately transparent.
  2. Prepare a solution of hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid of any reasonable concentration.
  3. Slowly pour the solution of potassium permanganate into the acidic solution of hydrogen peroxide.
  4. Watch bleaching of the solution of potassium permanganate.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles.
science_background: |
  This process is a combination of two reactions. On the one hand, this is an ordinary redox reaction, on the other hand, there is a catalytic disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of potassium permanganate.
  The release of oxygen is due to the occurrence of the catalytic disproportionation of the unstable peroxide oxygen. Discoloration of potassium permanganate is due to its reduction to manganese sulfate.
