step_by_step: |
  1. Obtain chlorine gas. There are many different ways.
  2. Collect chlorine gas into a chemical cylinder or test tube.
  3. Quickly add sodium into the cylinder with chlorine.
  4. Heat the pieces of sodium through the glass over a gas burner or alcohol lamp.
  5. Watch the cylinder fill with white smoke.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Work with poisonous gases only outdoors or in a hood.
science_background: |
  Chlorine gas is a strong oxidant. Metallic sodium is oxidized to sodium chloride, which forms the smoke. The interfacial reaction takes place very slowly, so heating is necessary.
