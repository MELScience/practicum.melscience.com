step_by_step: |
  1. Pour 50 ml of gasoline into a beaker.
  2. Cut 35 grams of foam into small pieces.
  3. Slowly lower the foam pieces into the beaker while stirring.
  4. Intensively stir the resulting mixture after all the foam is added.
  5. Prepare 2 samples with the same weight (napalm and gasoline).
  6. Ignite them away of flammable objects.
  7. Compare the burning time. Napalm should burn about ten times longer.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Work away from flammable objects. A fire extinguisher must be nearby.
science_background: |
  Plastic foam is made of polystyrene which is a non-polar polymer. Gasoline is a non-polar solvent. Non-polar polymers are soluble in it, forming a suspension.
  Napalm is easily ignited, burns relatively slowly (the speed of combustion is dependent on the viscosity), releasing thick black smoke (flame temperature of 900-1100 ° C depending on the type of fuel), due to its gel-like consistency it adheres well to hit targets, including vertical surfaces.
