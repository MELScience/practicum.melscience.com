reaction_formulas:
  - (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>)OC(O)C(O)O(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>) + H2O2 = 2C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>OH + C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
  - C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + Fluorophore = 2CO<sub>2</sub> + Fluorophore*
  - Fluorophore* = Fluorophore + hv

  - diethyl-phthalate
  - sodium-acetate
  - bpea
  - rubrene
  - 9-10-diphenylanthracene
  - rhodamine-b
  - tcpo

step_by_step: |
  1. Mix about 10 ml of diethyl phtalate, 50 mg of TCPO, 3 mg of fluorescent dye, and 100 mg of sodium acetate in a vial.
  2. Stir to dissolve all compounds.
  3. Add about 3 ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide into the vial and stir it.
  4. Use various fluorescent dyes to obtain various colors. BPEA for green, rubrene for yellow, 9,10-diphenylanthracene for blue, and rhodamine B for red.
  5. You may mix the resulting solutions together to obtain overlapping colors.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection and lab gloves.
  Avoid contact of hydrogen peroxide with skin.
science_background: |
  TCPO reacts with hydrogen peroxide and produces an intermediate - 1,2-dioxetanedione. It decomposes to CO<sub>2</sub> and excites a fluorophore. So the chemical reaction energy transfers to light emission energy of the excited fluorophore in these reactions.
  The wavelength of the emitted light depends on the nature of the flurophore. Thus BPEA emits green light, rubrene - yellow, 9,10-diphenylanthracene - blue, rhodamine B  - red.
  There is no light emission without a fluorophore in this reaction.
  Divanillyl oxalate, biphenyl oxalate also may be used as an energy source for fluorescence.
