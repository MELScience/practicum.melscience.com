step_by_step: |
  1. Take a container for oil (bottle, glass jar etc.) and fill it with vegetable oil.
  2. Take a cotton string and cut a several inch piece to make a wick.
  3. Soak the whole wick in oil and secure it in the container.
  4. Carefully ignite the tip of the wick.
safety_description: |
  There is a fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready. Make sure there is nothing flammable nearby. 
science_background: |
  Vegetable oil consists of various triglycerides containing unsaturated fatty acids. These substances are flammable and usually burn with a smoky flame (because of incomplete combustion of oil). Due to capillary effect oil climbs up on the wick and burns on the tip of the wick.
  It is better to use olive oil because it gives a more clear flame without bad smells.
