step_by_step: |
  1. Fill 1/4 of an empty plastic vial with 1% tannin solution (about 2 mL).
  2. Dip the brush into the tannin solution.
  3. Write a secret message on yellow paper between the lines or on any blank space.
  4. Let the paper dry. It will take 2–3 minutes.
  5. Moisten a cotton pad with 0.1M iron (II) sulfate solution FeSO<sub>4</sub>. You will need 15-20 drops.
  6. To reveal the message, rub the paper surface with the cotton pad.
  7. Wash the brush with water for use in future experiments.

  What is tannin?
  Tannins are a compound class of plant origin. They may be found in tea leafs, nuts, oak, and other trees bark. Tannins have brown-yellow color, astringent taste, and discreet pleasant odor (you may carefully smell the solution). The main ingredient of tannin solution in our kit is tannic acid, which is one of the most available tannins.
  Why does the secret message appear?
  Tannin molecules are able to bind with metal ions: for example, iron Fe or copper Cu (see the “Follow-up” section to learn how to reveal the secret message written with copper sulfate CuSO<sub>4</sub>). The reaction forms complex molecules exhibiting bold dark color. Hence, mixing tannin solution with iron sulfate FeSO<sub>4</sub> solution (containing iron (II) Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions) provides dark coloring and renders the secret message visible.
