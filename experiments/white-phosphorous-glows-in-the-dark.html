    title: Spontaneous Combustion of White Phosphorus
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Take a piece of paper.
  2. Dissolve some white phosphorous in gasoline in a test-tube.
  3. Pour some solution onto the paper. After a few seconds a white glow occurs.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab goggles and gloves. White phosphorus is very toxic and chemically active! Avoid contact of white phosphorous with skin. 
science_background: |
  White phosphorous is a very reactive substance. It slowly oxidizes in contact with air and emits white light. This phenomenon is called chemiluminescence.
  When the solution of white phosphorous in gasoline is placed on paper, gasoline evaporates and white phosphorous reacts with oxygen from air.
