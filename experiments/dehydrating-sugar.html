    title: Reaction of Sugar with Sulfuric Acid
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Pour a few grams of sugar in a beaker.
  2. Add concentrated sulfuric acid.
  3. Wait a few minutes.
  4. Watch the sugar become black and rapidly increase in volume
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Gloves.
science_background: |
  Concentrated sulfuric acid is a strong dehydrating agent. Thus, sulfuric acid reacts with sugar, thereby forming carbon. The increase in volume can be explained by the fact that the reaction products are oxidized to carbon dioxide and coal is loosened.
