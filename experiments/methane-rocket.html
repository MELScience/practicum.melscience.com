step_by_step: |
  1.	Prepare a strong plastic bottle of 0.3-0.5 l volume.
  2.	Measure its exact volume using water and a measuring cylinder.
  3.	Divide the bottle volume into 3 parts. Pour the volume of water equal to 1/3 of bottle volume.
  4.	Mark the water level with a waterproof marker.
  5.	Fill the whole volume of the bottle with water.
  6.	Prepare a large bowl filled with water.
  7.	Place the bottle into the bowl and lower it under the water keeping its mouth downwards.
  8.	Put the bottle upright.
  9.	Put the gas delivery tube to the bottle neck. 
  10.	Fill the bottle with methane to the marked level. Gas will replace water from the bottle. 
  11.	Change the gas source. Fill the rest part of the bottle with oxygen. 
  12.	Carefully lift the bottle from the water still keeping it upside down.
  13.	Seal the bottle with a cap.
  14.	The rocket is ready for blast off! Place the rocket on the launch pad 
  15.	Remove the cap and light the gas mixture inside the bottle with a lighted splint.
  16.	The gases react with a loud bang. The expanding hot gas pushes the rocket making it fly.

  Wear eye protection goggles. Cover your ears. Use each bottle for one demonstration only.
science_background: |
  When gas mixture is ignited methane reacts with oxygen producing water and carbon dioxide. The reaction is strongly exothermic. The energy releases in the form of light, sound and heat. The expanding under heating gas pushes the rocket making it fly. According to Avogadroâ€™s law the equal volumes of all gases contains the same number of molecules at given pressure and temperature. The stoichiometric ratio between methane and oxygen in combustion reaction is one part of methane to two parts of oxygen. Measuring volume of gases during mixture preparing allows obtaining the optimal ratio between components. The small rocket created in this experiment could be considered as a model of large space rockets. Since the usually used reaction of hydrogen combustion has some disadvantages  methane is tested as an alternative fuel for space rockets.
