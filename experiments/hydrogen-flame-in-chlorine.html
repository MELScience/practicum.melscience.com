step_by_step: |
  1. Obtain chlorine and hydrogen gases. There are many different ways.
  2. Collect chlorine and hydrogen gases into a chemical cylinder or test tube. Close it.
  3. Initiate the reaction using a powerful light source or by spark.
  4. Observe the explosion.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Work with poisonous gases only outdoors or in a hood.
science_background: |
  Chlorine gas is a strong oxidant. Hydrogen is oxidized to HCl, which forms the smoke. The reaction is a free radical reaction. It requires temperature or light initiation. It's best to use an ultraviolet light source, because it has the highest energy of radiation.
