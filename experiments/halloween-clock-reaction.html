title_name: Halloween clock reaction
descriptive_name:  Solutions in different beakers change their colors from colorless to orange and then become dark-blue one by one
scientific_name: Clock reaction between bisulfite, iodate and mercury(II) ions gives orange mercury iodide precipitate and after this - the dark-blue complex of iodine and starch
class: classics
week: colors
reaction_formulas:
  - Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = 2NaHSO<sub>3</sub>
  - IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> + 3HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> = I<sub>2</sub> + 3SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> + 3H<sup>+</sup>
  - Hg<sup>2+</sup> + 2I<sup>-</sup> = HgI<sub>2</sub>
  - IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> + 5I<sup>-</sup> + 6H<sup>+</sup> = 3I<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O
  - I<sub>2</sub> + starch = a blue-black complex
reagents:
  - sodium-metabisulfite
  - starch
  - mercury-ii-chloride
  - potassium-iodate

step_by_step: |
  1. Prepare solutions of sodium metabisulfite and starch in the first set of beakers. Approximately 4 g of starch and 13 g of sodium metabisulfite per 1 l of water.
  2. Prepare solutions of mercury(II) chloride in the second set of beakers. Approximatelly 3 g of mercury(II) chloride per 1 l of water.
  3. Prepare water solution of potassium iodide (in various concentrations) in the third set of beakers.
  4. Add the contens of the third set of beakers to the first one.
  5. Then contents of the second set of beakers should be simultaneously added to the mixture in the first set of beakers.
safety_description: |
  Mercury compounds are highly toxic! Filter off the mercury(II) iodide precipitate. If some of the mercury(II) chloride solution was unused, add excess sodium hydroxide to precipitate mercury hydroxide. Filter off the mercury hydroxide precipitate.
  All mercury compounds should be placed in sealed containers for  professional disposal .
  Wear eye protection and lab gloves.  
science_background: |
  Firstly the iodate(V) ions oxidize the hydrogensulphite ions: IO3(-) + 3 HSO3(-) = I2 + 3 SO4(2-) + 3 H(+)
  The hardly soluble mercury iodide is formed from Hg(2+) and I(-). 
  As soon as concentration of the HgI2 exceed its solubility, the solid orange mercury(II) iodide precipitates.
  After all mercury ions form a precipitate, excess of the I(-) ions stays.
  There is a reaction of comproportionation between the iodide and the iodate ions in the formed solution. Molecular iodine is formed.
  Then dark-blue complex I2 and starch is formed.
