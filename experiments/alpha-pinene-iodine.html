step_by_step: |
  1. Pour a small pile of crystalline iodine
  2. Add a drop of alpha-pinene to the center of the pile of iodine
  3. Observe the formation of iodine vapour
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Work only outdoors or in a hood.
science_background: |
  Alpha-pinene contains a double bond which allows it to react with iodine. The reaction takes place with a lot of rearrangements and is very exothermic. The generated heat causes the sublimation of iodine. Iodine vapor has a purple color.
