step_by_step: |
  1. Pour 300 mg of sulfur, 600 mg of potassium carbonate and 900 mg of potassium nitrate in a teaspoon.
  2. Fix the teaspoon in a stand.
  3. Ignite an alcohol lamp and put it under the spoon.
  4. Observe the melting of the reaction mixture, followed by an explosion.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Stand away from the experimental facility. Work away from flammable objects.
science_background: |
  The exact mechanism of this reaction is unknown. However, you will notice that the mixture resembles gunpowder (potassium nitrate + sulfur + coal). The difference is only in one component (potassium carbonate instead of sulfur). In our view, the role of potassium carbonate in this experiment is as a source of carbon dioxide, which is released by its decomposition and prevents the slow combustion of the reaction mixture (sulfur, in particular) in the air. Due to this fact, after accumulating the necessary activation energy, first the reaction proceeds rapidly and with an explosion. The first reaction proceeds with the formation of a large number of byproducts. Shown only main products.
