step_by_step: |
  1.	Fill the trough  about half full with  water.
  2.	Prepare a special device which will allow you to put the metal into the water keeping a  safe distance. Hook the metal with device.
  3.	Place a beaker with a small piece of cesium under oil into the liquid nitrogen.
  4.	Put all the equipment under a safety screen.
  5.	Move away.
  6.	Lift a piece of cerium using the device and drop it into the water.
  7.	The reaction proceeds with a bang.
safety_description: |
  The reaction is very rough! There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready. Use safety screen. There will be an explosion - keep a safe distance.
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection goggles or a face shield.
science_background: |
  Cesium is a very reactive alkaline metal with a pretty golden shine. When it comes in contact with water it reacts rapidly as follows:
  2Cs + H2O --> 2CsOH + H2
  A lot of heat is produced in this reaction. It passes faster than the same reaction of other alkaline metals (except for francium) because the alkaline properties increase with size of atom. Hydrogen formed in the reaction catches fire and reacts with the oxygen of air making the explosion:
  2H2 + O2 --> 2H2O
