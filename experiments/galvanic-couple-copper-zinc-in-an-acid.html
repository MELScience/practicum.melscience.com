step_by_step: |
  1. Pour some hydrochloric acid (or sulfuric acid) solution into a beaker.
  2. Put a tzinc granule here. Hydrogen gas begins evolve on the zinc granule surface.
  3. Touch the zinc with a isolated copper wire. Hydrogen gas stops evolve on the zinc but begins evolveon the copper wire.
  4. If break the contact of metals hydrogen continues evolve on the zinc surface.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
  Avoid contact of acid with skin.
science_background: |
  Zinc reacts with acid forming zinc ions (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) and hydrogen gas.
  If thouch the zinc with a copper wire, zinc and copper constitute a galvanic cell. Zinc dissolves and gives electrones to copper.  Hydrogen ions attaches electrons firming molecules of hydrogen gas. If break the contact of zinc and copper, hydrogen will evolve on a zinc surface again.
