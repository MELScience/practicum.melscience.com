step_by_step: |
  1. Prepare a mixture of water and acetic acid 4/1.
  2. Mix 100 ml of this mixture with 1.7 g of bismuth oxynitrate. This is the first solution.
  3. Dissolve 40 g of potassium iodate in 100 ml of water. This is the second solution.
  4. Mix together 5 ml of both the first and the second solutions, add 20 ml of acetic acid and 70 ml of water.
  5. Add a few drops of the prepared solution into the test tube with an alkaloid solution (for example, quinine). An orange precipitate is formed.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection and lab gloves.
  Avoid contact of acid with skin.
science_background: |
  Bismuth oxynitrate (commercially available Bi<sub>5</sub>O(OH)<sub>9</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>) reacts with potassium iodide in an acidic solution and forms potassium bismuth iodide (typically represented as BiI<sub>4</sub>K) solution. The orange mixture prepared in this experiment is the Dragendorff's reagent used for detection of alkaloids in a test solution.
  Actually a number of modifications of this reagent exist. Nitric, hydrochloric, tartaric acid may be used for the preparation of Dragendorff's reagent.
