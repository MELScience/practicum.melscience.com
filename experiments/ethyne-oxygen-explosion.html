step_by_step: |
  1. Obtain acetylene. Put several grams of calcium carbide into a flask equipped with venting with water. Also, acetylene may be taken from a cylinder.
  2. Fill the balloon with exuding acetylene.
  3. For a more powerful explosion, oxygen may be pumped from the cylinder. Also, oxygen can be obtained in a variety of other ways.
  4. Hold the balloon to a source of fire, while being at a long distance.
  5. Watch the explosion of acetylene.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Ear protection. You need to be at a long distance from the ballon.
science_background: |
  Acetylene as an alkyne, it burns well in oxygen. Thus, a large amount of heat is produced. An explosion occurs at significant concentrations of acetylene.
