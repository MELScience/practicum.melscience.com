step_by_step: |
  1. Make sure that you have fine steel wool, thick steel wool does not burn well
  2. Start fire using a 9V battery, just touch the positive and negative terminals of a 9V battery against the steel wool
safety_description: |
  Temperatures of steel wool and fire in this experiment could exceed 1,000&deg;C (1800&deg;F). Wear eye protection. 
science_background: |
  In normal conditions iron is not flammable. Thus you cannot ignite a nail. It is because a normal piece of iron has very small surface which is not enough to self-sustain its burning. But steel wool consists of very thin threads which have enough surface area that heat produced is self-sustaining.
