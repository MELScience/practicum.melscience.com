    title: Ferrous chloride synthesis procedure
    language: en

step_by_step: |
  1. Put a wisp of steel wool and pour about 100mL of water and 100mL of hydrochloric acid into the flask. Ferrous chloride is formed.
  2. When iron has dissolved in acid, filter out the formed solution. It should be lime green.
  3. Add some hydrogen peroxide to this solution (3% drugstore hydrogen peroxide). Ferric chloride is formed and the solution becomes brown.
  4. To regenerate lime green ferrous chloride solution, add some more steel wool. 
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
  Prevent skin contact with acid solution.
  The experiment should be carried out in a well-ventilated room.
science_background: |
  Iron reacts with hydrochloric acid producing ferrous chloride (FeCl2) and hydrogen gas. Ferrous chloride will easily oxidize to ferric chloride (FeCl3) in contact with air and in the presence of hydrochloric acid.
  This reaction can be sped up by adding  hydrogen peroxide.
