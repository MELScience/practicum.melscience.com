step_by_step: |
  1. Take as many Petri dishes as you use reagents (you may use another type of thermostable glassware).
  2. Put a few grams of each reagent in individual Petri dishes.
  3. Pour some alcohol (methyl, ethyl or iso-propyl) into each dish.
  4. Ignite alcohol in the dishes.
safety_description: |
  Carry out the experiment in distance of highly flammable substances and objects.
  Methyl alcohol is very toxic!
science_background: |
  Ions of some elements emit specific wave length light when heated in the flame. Due to this, the flame is colored in various colors:
  Lithium - red;
  Sodium - yellow;
  Pottasium - violet;
  Strontium - red-orange;
  Barium - yellow-green;
  Magnesium - orange-yellow;
  Copper(II) - green;
  Boric acid - green.
