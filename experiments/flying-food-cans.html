    language: en

step_by_step: |
  1. Take a tin can and install a modified piezo-electric gas lighter into it.
  2. Pour some water into a beaker.
  3. Place some calcium carbide into the beaker and cover it by the invert can to collect some gas.
  4. Ignite the collected acetylene by the lighter.
safety_description: |
  Keep a distance of 2 meters.
  Wear eyes protection.
  Make sure there is nothing flammable nearby.
science_background: |
  Calcium carbide reacts with water producing acetylene.
  Acetylene is high flammable, and explodes, when there is an electric spark between the piezo-electric gas lighter contacts.
