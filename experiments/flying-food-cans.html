title_name: Flying food cans
descriptive_name: Food cans fly up like rockets
scientific_name: Through the reaction between  calcium carbide and water, ethyne is produced, and ethyne throws up food cans when ignited
category: burning
class: fire
week: flame, 
reaction_formulas:
  - CaC<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>
  - 3C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> + 4O<sub>2</sub> = 2C + 3CO + CO<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O
reagents:
  - calcium-carbide
  - water

    language: en

step_by_step: |
  1. Take a tin can and install a modified piezo-electric gas lighter into it.
  2. Pour some water into a beaker.
  3. Place some calcium carbide into the beaker and cover it by the invert can to collect some gas.
  4. Ignite the collected acetylene by the lighter.
safety_description: |
  Keep a distance of 2 meters.
  Wear eyes protection.
  Make sure there is nothing flammable nearby.
science_background: |
  Calcium carbide reacts with water producing acetylene.
  Acetylene is high flammable, and explodes, when there is an electric spark between the piezo-electric gas lighter contacts.
