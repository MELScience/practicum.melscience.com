step_by_step: |
  1. Prepare solutions of different indicators.
  2. Add base (sodium hydroxide solution) to these solutions to change their color.
  3. Put a piece of dry ice in each solution.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles.
  Prevent skin contact with acid and base solutions.
science_background: |
  Dry ice consists of carbon dioxide. Because CO2 is a weak acid oxide it produces weak carbonic acid (H2CO3) in the reaction with water.
  This acid reacts with sodium hydroxide , in result Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 are formed.
  While the pH changes the indicator solution gradually changes color in order to the indicator properties.
  Thus we can obtain characteristic color transitions:
  The universal indicator turns into all the colors of the raonbow; 
  Phenolphthalein - from pink to colorless at pH range 8.2-10.0;
  Thymolphthalein - from blue to colorless at pH range 8.3-10.6;
  Thymol blue - from blue to yellow at pH range 8.0-9.6;
  Phenol red - from red to yellow at pH range 6.8-8.4;
  Bromothymol blue - from blue to yellow at pH range: 6.0-7.6;
  Indigo carmine - from blue to yellow at pH range: 11.4-13.0;
  You may use other indicators for this experiment.
