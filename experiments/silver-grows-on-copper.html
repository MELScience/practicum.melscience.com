    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Prepare solutions of silver nitrate in water of different concentrations.
  2. Pour solutions in beakers.
  3. Put in the beakers copper wires. A few minutes later silver crystals are obtained on the copper wires. 
safety_description: |
  Wear lab goggles and gloves. 
science_background: |
  When copper wire is put in the silver nitrate solution, redox reaction between silver ions and copper metal occurs. Silver ions is reduced to silver metal. Copper is oxidizes to copper (II) ions. Thus the crystals of silver metals is obtained on the copper wires.
  The rate of this reaction depands on concentration of silver ions. Because of this in the more consentrated solution more crystals grow.
