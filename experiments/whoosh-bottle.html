step_by_step: |
  1.	To perform this experiment you need one or more of the following alcohols: methanol, ethanol, isopropanol.
  2.	Prepare a large polycarbonate bottle for each alcohol you use. The volume of the  bottle should be about 16-20 dm3. Coolers  are suitable for this purpose. The vessel should be completely dry before the experiment. 
  3.	Pour about 30 ml of alcohol into the bottle.
  4.	Wait for some time in order to fill the vessel with alcohol vapors.
  5.	Light the wooden splint and hold it to the bottle neck to ignite the alcohol vapors.
  6.	It will easily catch fire with a loud “woolsh” sound.
safety_description: |
  Do not use too much alcohol. Wear eye protection goggles. Keep a safe distance. There is a some fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
science_background: |
  This experiment is based on the combustion reaction of alcohol vapors.  Alcohols are volatile substances. They easily evaporate and fill the vessel mixing with oxygen of air. The alcohol vapors are also flammable and readily burn after ignition, producing carbon dioxide and water. Reactions look as follows:
  For methanol:
  2CH3OH + 3O2 --> 2CO2 + 4H2O
  For ethanol:
  C2H5OH + 3O2 --> 2CO2 + 3H2O
  For isopropanol:
  2C3H8O + 9O2 --> 6CO2 + 8H2O
  The combustion of vapors is  very fast since the alcohol molecules in the  gas phase have a much greater surface area for the reaction in comparison with the liquid state. Alcohol molecules are spread in the whole volume of the bottle. That’s why when they burn it looks like a dancing flame ring or plate. The confined space of the vessel and the rapidness of the combustion promote the “whoosh” sound occurring during the reaction.
