step_by_step: |
  1.	Weight out separately 5 g of potassium chlorate, 10 g of strontium nitrate and 5 g of sugar.
  2.	Prepare a beaker.
  3.	Place the potassium chlorate into the beaker. 
  4.	Add strontium nitrate to the potassium chlorate. Then add sugar. Follow the mixing order.
  5.	Mix the components gently. Do not use a spatula.
  6.	Empty the beaker on a ceramic plate and ignite it using a gas burner.
  7.	Mixture burns with a red flame.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Perform this demonstration in the fume hood or outside. This is a violent reaction. Keep a safe distance. There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
science_background: |
  This reaction could be considered as a strontium flame test. Each element has a characteristic emission spectrum. This feature allows to determine elements by their flame color. Strontium produces a red color.
  Oxidation of sugar by chlorate and nitrate ions is a very exothermic reaction:
  2Sr(NO3)2 + 4 KClO3 + C12H22O11 --> 4KCl + 10CO2 + 2N2 + 2SrCO3 + 11H2O
  The evolution of heat excites strontium atoms. Electrons move to higher energy levels. When they return to ground state they emit energy in the form of light of special wavelength. For strontium this wavelength corresponds to red light.
