step_by_step: |
  1.	Prepare a solution which you want to test on the presence of phosphate ions. For demonstration take a sodium phosphate solution.
  2.	Add a few drops of silver nitrate solution. If the solution under study contains phosphate ions the formation of a yellow precipitate is observed.

  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves.
science_background: |
  Qualitative analysis is the determination of the presence of an element in compounds and mixtures without estimation of its amount. Qualitative reactions are one of the most common tools of qualitative analysis.  If the sample under study contains ions specific to the qualitative reaction the release of gas bubbles or  precipitate formation or color change is expected. This experiment demonstrates one of the ways to detect PO4<sup>-3</sup> ions.  Sodium phosphate is used for testing qualitative reactions on phosphate ions. When sodium phosphate solution is mixed with the silver nitrate solution it forms a yellow precipitate of silver phosphate
