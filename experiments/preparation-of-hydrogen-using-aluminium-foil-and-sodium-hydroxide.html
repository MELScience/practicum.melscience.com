step_by_step: |
  1. Put several pieces of aluminium foil in a flask. 
  2. Pour sodium hydroxide solution in this flask. Sodium hydroxide solution is often sold as a drain cleaner.
  3. Hydrogen gas will be produced during this process.
  4. Put a balloon over the flask opening to collect the hydrogen gas.
safety_description: |
  Wears safety goggles because sodium hydroxide solution may spray from the flask during this active reaction.
  Please note that it is a very active exothermic reaction - the flask will become very hot soon.
science_background: |
  Aluminium is a very reactive metal but it does not react with water because it is covered with
  protective layer of aluminium oxide. Sodium hydroxide will remove the aluminium oxide cover layer
  and aluminium starts to react with water:

  2Al + 6H2O = 2Al(OH)3 + 3H2↑
  
  Al(OH)3 + NaOH = Na[Al(OH)4]
