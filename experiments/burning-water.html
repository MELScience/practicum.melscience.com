step_by_step: |
  1. Pour a few milliliters of hexane into a 100 ml flask.
  2. Fill the flask with ordinary tap water almost to the brim.
  3. Ignite the contents of the flask from the top.
  4. Observe the burning water.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Work away from flammable objects.
science_background: |
  Hexane is a nonpolar substance unlike water. For this reason, these two liquids are immiscible. Furthermore, hexane is lighter than water therefore it forms the upper layer. Because the water is at the bottom and there is hexane in the top layer, the water does not prevent for burning.
