step_by_step: |
  1. Take a flat dish like a glass Petri dish
  2. Pour filtered  tin (II) chloride solution (10-20g of SnCl2 in 100mL of water) just to cover the bottom of the dish
  3. Place two electrodes from 9V battery into the dish
  4. Tin crystals will start to grow on the cathode and you will be able to see tin crystall grawing in real time
safety_description: |
  Tin(II) chloride is moderately toxic. Avoid contacting it with your eyes and skin. Wears safety goggles and chemical-resistant gloves.
