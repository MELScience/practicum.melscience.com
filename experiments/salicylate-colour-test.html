step_by_step: |
  1. Prepare 0.1% solution of iron (III) chloride in water.
  2. Prepare a set of salicylic acid water solutions of various concentrations and pour these solutions into test-tubes.
  3. Prepare a water solution of aspirin in a test-tube.
  4. Add about 1 ml of the iron (III) chloride solution into each test-tube. Fix color change of solutions.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection and lab gloves.
science_background: |
  Iron (III) ions form a blue-violet complex with salicylate dianions, and  the intensity of the color depends on the concentration of salicylate dianions. With acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) a pale pink complex with iron (III) is formed. These two reactions are used for detecting salicylate presence and determining the purity of aspirin.
