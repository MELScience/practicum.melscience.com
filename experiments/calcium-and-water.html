    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1.	Prepare a beaker with water.
  2.	Put a piece of metallic calcium into the water.
  3.	It reacts vigorously liberating gas and turning water milky-white.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves.
science_background: |
  Calcium reacts with water very vigorously. Due to the formation of a large amount of hydrogen gas the reaction looks like boiling. The second product of the reaction is calcium hydroxide. This substance is responsible for the milky-white color of the liquid. The reaction is exothermic and is followed by evolution of heat.
