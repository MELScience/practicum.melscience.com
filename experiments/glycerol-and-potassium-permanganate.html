    title: Reaction of Potassium Permanganate and Glycerin.
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1.	Place about 2-3 mg of potassium permanganate on a heat-proof mat.
  2.	Make a small dimple in the center of the pile.
  3.	Pour a few drops of glycerol in the dimple of the pile. Use a pipette.
  4.	Wait about 20 seconds.
  5.	The mixture begins producing steam, glycerol burns with a purple flame.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves.
science_background: |
  The considered reaction is oxidation of glycerol (C3H5(OH)3) by potassium permanganate (KMnO4). When the components come into contact the process starts:
  14KMnO4 + 4C3H5(OH)3 --> 7Mn2O3 + 7K2CO3 + 5CO2 + 16H2O
  Glycerol is oxidized to water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The process is highly exothermic and is followed by a great evolution of heat. The released heat is enough to evaporate water. The presence of manganese in oxidation state 7 makes the fire purple.
