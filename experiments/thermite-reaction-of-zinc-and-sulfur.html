step_by_step: |
  1.	Place about 1 gram of powdered zinc and 1 gram of powdered sulfur into a beaker.
  2.	Mix the substances by rotating the beaker.
  3.	The next step of the experiment should be performed in a fume hood.
  4.	Pour the zinc and sulfur mixture on a fire-proof surface making a small pile.
  5.	Heat a steel rod with gas burner.
  6.	Hold the rod to the pile and touch the substances for the reaction to start.
  7.	Sulfur and zinc reacts vigorously with evolution of a large amount of heat and smoke. 
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves. The reaction is very violent and flammable! Use a fire-resistant workplace. Use a hood or carry out the experiment outdoors away from flammable objects. 
science_background: |
  Zinc and sulfur react producing zinc sulfide
  Zn + S --> ZnS
  The reaction is highly exothermic and is accompanied by bright green-yellow flashes and evolution of a large amount of heat. The side products also involve some small amounts of zinc oxide and sulfur dioxide. Zinc sulfide is the main form of zinc in nature. It occurs in the form of mineral ore sphalerite.
