    title: Striking a Match in Hydrogen
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Fill  a special container with hydrogen. There should be no oxygen!
  2. Try to ignite a match in an atmosphere of hydrogen. The match doesn't burn.
safety_description: |
  Wear thermoprotective gloves, eye and hair protection.
  Prevent penetration of oxygen into the container with hydrogen!
science_background: |
  Hydrogen doesn't contribute to burning. Thus if there is no oxygen in the container, the match doesn't burn.
