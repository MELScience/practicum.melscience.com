step_by_step: |
  1. Put small amounts of individual fluorescent substances and their mixture on a TLC plate.
  2. Pour an ethanol and acetone mixture into a beaker. You need a little bit of the mixture, just to plunge the end of the TLC plate.
  3. Insert the TLC plate into the beaker. Eluent is soaked by the plate.
  4. Illuminate the TLC plate with UV light for the spots to glow.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
science_background: |
  When the eluent is drawn up the plate by capillary action, different substances ascend the TLC plate at different rates. If the analyte is a mixture of different compounds, separation is achieved. This effect is obtained due to the difference of interactions between the substance, the adsorbent material (the stationary phase) and the eluent (the movible phase).
