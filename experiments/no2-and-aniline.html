step_by_step: |
  1.	Since nitrogen dioxide is a hazardous gas, this experiment must be performed only in a fume hood.
  2.	Prepare the test tube. Put the stand into the fume hood.
  3.	Cool down the test tube.
  4.	Put the test tube on the stand.
  5.	Fill the test tube with nitrogen dioxide.
  6.	Add a few drops of aniline to the test tube. Use a long pipette.
  7.	Aniline reacts spontaneously and generates lots of smoke and fire.
safety_description: |
  This experiment must be performed only in a fume hood. Wear eye protection goggles and gloves.
science_background: |
  Aniline reacts with nitrogen dioxide readily.  This is a highly exothermic process. The mixture easily catches fire when the reaction passes:
  8C6H5NH2 + 62NO2 --> 48CO2 + 28H2O +35N2 
  Theoretically all products of the reaction are gaseous. But in fact the combustion process is not fully complete and some carbon is produced as an intermediate product.
