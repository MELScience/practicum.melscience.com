    title: Magnesium and silver nitrate flash reaction
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Put about 0.5 g of magnesium and silver nitrate mixture onto a nonflammable plate.
  2. Add a drop of warm water using a long pipette. A few seconds later an explosion occurs.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection. Keep a safe distance.
  Use only dry reagents to prepare the mixture.
  Don't use large amounts of the mixture because it may be danger.
science_background: |
  Magnesium displaces silver from its salts, because magnesium is higher in the reactivity series than silver. The reaction between silver nitrate and magnesium is very violent and exothermic.
  Due to heat producing, the excess of magnesium burns in air.
