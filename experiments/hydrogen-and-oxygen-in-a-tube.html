    title: Explosive Reaction of Hydrogen and Oxygen Using Balloons
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Fill a long reinforced tube with the hydrogen and oxygen mixture and close it with a stopper. The ratio of the components should be 2 hydrogen volumes per 1 oxygen volume.
  2. Carefully open one of the ends of the tube and bring a burner. An explosion, followed by a loud bang, occurs in the tube.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
  There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
  The mixture of hydrogen and oxygen is dangerously explosive!
science_background: |
  Hydrogen reacts with oxygenproducing water. This reaction is very vigorous, and the flame spreads rapidly in the tube.
