    title: Dropping charcoal into liquid oxygen in slow motion
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Heat pieces of the charcoal to red-hot.
  2. Pour the liquid oxygen into the robust metal cauldron (liquid oxygen can cause brittleness of materials!).
  3. Drop a piece of the charcoal into the liquid oxygen.
safety_description: |
  Wear eyes protection.
  Avoid the chilblains  by liquid oxygen.
science_background: |
  When the charcoal hits the liquid oxygen surface the oxygen vapour contributes to the intensive burning.
  The reaction will continue until all the coal burns.
