step_by_step: |
  1.	Put several pieces of aluminum foil in a flask. 
  2.	Pour sodium hydroxide solution in this flask. Sodium hydroxide solution is often sold as a drain cleaner.
  3.	Reaction producing hydrogen begins.
  4.	Fit the flask with a rubber stopper and gas delivery tube.
  5.	Dip the tube into the soap solution.
  6.	Light up a splinter.
  7.	Pull the tube and let the soap bubble form. It is filled with hydrogen which is lighter than air and hops off.  
  8.	Hold the splinter to the bubble. The bubble rapidly catches fire.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves. Hydrogen gas is very flammable and yields explosive mixtures with air. Perform this demonstration outdoors. Perform away from all flammable materials.
science_background: |
  Aluminum is a very reactive metal but it does not react with water because it is covered with a protective layer of aluminum oxide. Sodium hydroxide will remove the aluminum oxide cover layer and aluminum starts to react with water:
  2Al + 6H<sub>2</sub>O + 2NaOH --> 2NaAl(OH)<sub>4</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>
  In this reaction hydrogen gas is produced. Soap bubbles are formed by the gas passing through the soap solution. Thus they are filled with hydrogen. Hydrogen is a very flammable gas and easily ignites when you hold the burning splinter to the bubble. When it burns it looks like a fireball. The reaction is:
  2H<sub>2</sub>+O<sub>2</sub> --> 2H<sub>2</sub>O
