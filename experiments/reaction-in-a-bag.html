step_by_step: |
  1. Put 2 teaspoons of calcium chloride in a ziplock bag.
  2. Put one teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate in the other corner of the ziplock bag.
  3. Carefully take the bag and pour 10 ml of phenol red into it so that the components do not mix.
  4. Close the ziplock bag and mix ingredients.
  5. Observe how the bag inflates and the color changes.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Use gloves.
science_background: |
  Interaction of calcium chloride with sodium bicarbonate leads to the formation of carbon dioxide that fills the bag.
  This reaction is exothermic, and therefore, it forms calcium carbonate and carbon dioxide, instead of calcium hydrogen carbonate. The color change of the indicator is caused by changes in the reaction medium due to the formation of carbonic acid.
