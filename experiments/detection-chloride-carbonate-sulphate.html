step_by_step: |
  1.	Take 3 flasks. Pour sodium carbonate into flask #1, sodium chloride into  flask #2 and sodium sulphate into  flask #3. Mark the flasks and play detective.
  2.	Take 3 test-tubes. Pour 3 ml of the solutions #1, #2 and #3 into them. Mark the test-tubes with the number of the flask.
  3.	Add 3 ml of hydrochloric acid into each test-tube. The gas is released in the tube #1.
  4.	Repeat point 2.
  5.	Add 3 ml of silver nitrate solution into each test-tube. The white precipitate forms in the tube #2.
  6.	Repeat point 2. 
  7.	Add 3 ml of barium nitrate solution into each test-tube. The white precipitate forms in the tube #3.Take a test-tube, pour 3 ml of iron (III) chloride solution into it. Add dropwise 1-3 ml of potassium thiocyanate and shake the mixture. You have a red or dark-red solution of K<sub>3</sub>[Fe(SCN)<sub>6</sub>].

  Be careful with the different chemical reagents. Use protective gloves and googles when you work with hydrochloric acid.
science_background: |
  In this experiment the ability of substances to react with specific reagents is used for detection of inorganic ions in the solutions. These reactions are called qualitative reactions. A Qualitative reaction is a reaction that allows us to say whether there is a substance in the solution or not, but does not allow say how much of it there is.
  For the detection of carbonate CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> ions we should add a small amount of acid to the solution. An Ion exchange reaction occurs forming carbonic acid. But carbonic acid is unstable; it decomposes forming carbon dioxide and water:
  Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 2HCl --> CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + 2NaCl.
  We can detect chloride Cl<sup>-</sup> ions in the solution by adding silver ions. A White precipitate forms as a result of this reaction:
  NaCl + AgNO<sub>3</sub> --> AgCl + NaNO<sub>3</sub>. Also, the silver nitrate solution can be used to detect bromine Br<sup>-</sup> and iodine I<sup>-</sup> ions.
  Adding barium chloride to the solution with sulphate SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>ions can show presence of these ions in the solution: 
  Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + BaNO<sub>3</sub> --> BaSO<sub>4</sub> + 2NaNO<sub>3</sub>. This is a qualitative reaction for detection of barium Ba<sup>2+</sup>  and sulphate SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> ions.
