step_by_step: |
  1.	Prepare a large volumetric cylinder (500 ml).
  2.	Pour 75 ml of H2SO4 solution.
  3.	Add 75 ml of isopropanol. Pour it carefully along the cylinder’s wall.
  4.	Drop about half a teaspoon of KMnO4 to the solution.
  5.	When it is added to the isopropanol/H2SO4 mixture the liquid turns dark.
  6.	When all components are mixed together the reaction starts. Move away until the reaction stops. It is very violent and proceeds with a great evolution of heat. It makes the solution boil. At the end of the reaction the solution becomes colorless.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves. This is a violent reaction. Keep a safe distance. There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
science_background: |
  In the considered experiment the oxidation reaction of isopropanol by permanganate ion is studied. Permanganate ions are a very intense purple color. If its concentration is high enough the solution looks dark. When potassium permanganate (KMnO4) is mixed together with sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and isopropanol (CH3CHOHCH3) a reaction begins. 
  2KMnO4 + 5CH3CHOHCH3 + 3H2SO4 --> 2MnSO4 + 5CH3COCH3 + K2SO4 + 8H2O
  The reaction is accompanied by evolution of a large amount of heat. The mixture boils rapidly. After the reaction is complete the solution turns clear since the products are colorless.
