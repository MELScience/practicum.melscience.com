step_by_step: |
  1.	For this experiment we need to obtain chlorine gas. Since it is very hazardous this experiment should be performed only in a fume hood. 
  2.	Prepare the following equipment: a graduated cylinder, gas delivery system, stand, and a 250 ml flask. The gas delivery system consists of a rubber stopper, short glass tube, flexible connection and J-shaped long glass tube. The length of the J-shaped long glass tube should exceed the height of cylinder. 
  3.	The required reagents are: household bleach (NaClO), concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl), water (H2O) and calcium carbide (CaC2).
  4.	Pour about 100 ml of household bleach into the flask.
  5.	Set the flask on the stand.
  6.	Fit the flask with a rubber stopper.
  7.	Fill the cylinder with water.
  8.	Put the J-shaped tube down into the cylinder.
  9.	To generate chlorine add about 10 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid to the flask with household bleach.
  10.	Chlorine gas will be released from J-shaped tube. 
  11.	Add a few pieces of calcium carbide to the cylinder. When it comes in contact with water acetylene is formed. 
  12.	The reaction between two gases produce sparks.

  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves. Since chlorine is very hazardous this experiment should be performed only in a fume hood or outdoors. 
science_background: |
  In this experiment two gases reacts with bright flashes of light. The first gas is chlorine. It is generated when concentrated hydrochloric acid is added to household bleach:
  NaClO + 2HCl --> Cl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + NaCl
  The second one is acetylene. Acetylene is the product of the reaction between calcium carbide and water:
  CaC<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O --> C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>
  In the acetylene molecule two carbon atoms are bounded together with a triple bond. This means that three electron pairs are shared between to atoms. This bond is highly unsaturated. Chlorine atoms have high electron affinity and break down the triple bound of acetylene easily. They attach to the acetylene molecule forming dichloroethylene and tetrachloroethane. This reaction has low activation energy and occurs spontaneously when bubbles of the two gases collide. 
  C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> --> C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>
  C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> + 2Cl<sub>2</sub> --> C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>
