    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Pour some water into a beaker.
  2. Add 5-6 drops of litmus.
  3. Put a piece of calcium carbonate (marble) into a test-tube.
  4. Pour hydrochloric acid into the test-tube and close it with a stopper with an outlet tube.
  5. Put the end of the outlet tube into the solution of litmus. The produced gas (carbon dioxide) will bubble through the solution, and the color of the solution will change.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab goggles and gloves. Avoid contact of hydrochloric acid with skin. 
science_background: |
  Carbon dioxide CO<sub>2</sub> is dissolved in water. When it dissolves in water a partial reaction with forming carbonic acid occurs. It is detected with litmus. The solution changes color from blue to red.
  Carbon dioxide may be obtained from the reaction of calcium carbonate with hydrochloric acid.
