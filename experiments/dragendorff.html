step_by_step: |
  1. Pour 0.5 g of bismuth nitrate into an empty beaker. Add about 10 ml of distilled water. The mixture should be like a suspension.
  2. Add 10 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Stir the resulting mixture.
  3. Pour 4 g of potassium iodide into another beaker, add a little water and stir until KI is completely dissolved.
  4. Mix the two solutions.
  5. Observe the formation of a dark orange solution.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Work in a fume hood.
science_background: |
  Bismuth nitrate is the most commercially available reagent of Bi. It reacts with potassium iodide in an acidic solution and forms potassium bismuth iodide (typically represented as BiI4K) solution. The orange mixture prepared in this experiment is the Dragendorffâ€™s reagent used for detection of alkaloids in a test solution.
