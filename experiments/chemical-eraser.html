step_by_step: |
  1.	To perform this experiment you need to prepare: potassium permanganate, vinegar, hydrogen peroxide solution, water, a flask, cotton swabs, a ballpoint pen, a sheet of paper, wipes and an iron.
  2.	Draw or write something on a piece of paper.
  3.	Mix potassium permanganate with vinegar in a flask.
  4.	Soak a cotton swab in the obtained solution and lead round the picture.
  5.	Take another cotton swab and moisture it with water. Wash off the excess of the solution.
  6.	Dry the paper with a wipe.
  7.	Pour hydrogen peroxide on the picture.
  8.	Dry the paper with a wipe.
  9.	Iron the paper and put it under a press.
  10.	The picture will disappear.

  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves.
science_background: |
  This experiment demonstrates the very effective oxidative degradation of ink pigment. Two active oxidative agents – potassium permanganate and hydrogen peroxide are used for this purpose. Acetic acid is applied to control pH conditions. The overall process could be written as follows:
  H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> + 2H<sup>+</sup> + pigment (colored form) --> 2O<sub>2</sub> + Mn<sup>2+</sup> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O + pigment (colorless oxidized form)
