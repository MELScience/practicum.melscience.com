    title: Petrol in hydrogen
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Fill an inverted glass cylinder with hydrogen. Because hydrogen is lighter than air, it will stay in the cylinder.
  2. Secure a piece of paper soaked in petrol in the cylinder.
  3. Connect a tube with an igniter on the end to a balloon with oxygen.
  4. Insert the tube into the cylinder, open an oxygen feed and quickly ignite it.
  5. Try to ignite the paper with this flame. Paper burns only directly in the flame, but if you remove the flame the paper stops burning.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles.
  There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
  When oxygen is fed, ignite it quickly, because if it will accumulate in the cylinder, an explosion may occur.
science_background: |
  Oxygen reacts with hydrogen after ignition and the flame is obtained. Hydrogen does not support burning, thus petrol can burn only directly in flame, because some oxygen, which has not reacted yet with hydrogen, may react with petrol.
