step_by_step: |
  1. You will need AA lithium batteries. They are marked with blue or red colours.
  2. Take pliers or nippers and make a hole in the flat part of the battery.
  3. Enlarge the hole and remove the metal capsule of the battery.
  4. Remove the rolled up content of the battery.
  5. Take a jar or glass with kerosene or mineral oil.
  6. Unfold the roll and pull out the plate of metallic lithium. Place lithium in the kerosene or mineral oil.
safety_description: |
  Wear protective gloves and goggles. Be careful with the metal parts of the battery.
science_background: |
  The battery is a galvanic cell, an electrochemical cell that derives electrical energy from spontaneous redox reactions taking place within the cell. Each cell contains a positive terminal, or cathode, and a negative terminal, or anode. Electrolytes allow ions to move between the electrodes and terminals, which allows current to flow out of the battery to perform work.
  Lithium batteries have lithium metal or lithium compounds as an anode in the battery. The most common type of lithium cell used in consumer applications uses metallic lithium as anode and manganese dioxide as cathode, with a salt of lithium dissolved in an organic solvent.
