step_by_step: |
  1.	Since chlorine is a hazardous gas, this experiment must be performed only in a fume hood.
  2.	Prepare the flask. Put it into the fume hood.
  3.	Put a piece of aluminum foil on the wire.
  4.	Fill the flask with chlorine. 
  5.	Heat the aluminum foil with a gas burner.
  6.	Place the foil into the flask.
  7.	Aluminum burns in chlorine atmosphere. The white steam appears.
safety_description: |
   This experiment must be performed only outside or in a fume hood. Wear eye protection goggles and gloves.
science_background: |
  In this experiment the aluminum is oxidized by chlorine gas. This reaction is highly exothermic and is accompanied by flame and formation of white steam of aluminum chloride:
  2Al + 3Cl2 --> 2AlCl3
