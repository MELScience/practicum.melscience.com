step_by_step: |
  1. Place a plate in a protective box.
  2. Put some iodine crystals onto the plate.
  3. Put a piece of potassium onto the plate near iodine.
  4. Push the piece of potassium using a long glass rod and thus place it into a handful of iodine. A few seconds later a violent explosion occurs.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
  There is an explosion - use a protection shield!
science_background: |
  Potassium reacts with iodine forming potassium iodide. This is a very violent reaction, it occurs with an explosion. A lilac colored flame can be seen in this demonstration - it is the characteristic color of potassium in a flame.
