step_by_step: |
  1. Put the mixture of paraffin wax and potassium permanganate into a test-tube.
  2. Heat the test-tube with a burner. An exotermic reaction with flashes occurs.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
  There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready. Make sure there is nothing flammable nearby.
science_background: |
  Paraffin wax is a mixture of various hydrocarbons, primarily alkanes. Alkanes are not oxidized by potassium permanganate at room temperature, but can react under heating. The mixture of carbon acids and other organic compounds is formed in this case.
  A violent exothermic reaction occurs in the mixture of paraffin wax and potassium permanganate. If you overheat the mixture, the products of pyrolysis ignite near the mouth of the test-tube.
