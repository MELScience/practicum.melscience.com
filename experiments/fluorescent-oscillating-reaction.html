step_by_step: |
  1. Mix 16 g of malonic acid, 0.30 g of potassium bromide and 300 ml of water. It is solution A.
  2. Mix 13 g of potassium bromate and 300 ml of water. It is solution B.
  3. Mix 0.045 g of tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride hexahydrate, 0.38 g of cerium(IV) nitrate and 150 ml of 6M sulfuric acid. It is solution C.
  4. Put a magnetic stir bar and pour solutions A and B into a 1l beaker, place the beaker on a magnetic stirrer and start to stir.
  5. Pour solution C into the beaker.
  6. Carefully lower a UV lamp into the beaker and secure it so that the liquid does not contact with the socket of the lamp.
  7. Make it dark and switch on the UV lamp. There are oscillations between bright and dark fluorescent orange in the solution.

  Wear eye protection and lab gloves.
  Avoid contact with acids with skin. 
science_background: |
  This reaction is a modification of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, and has the same mechanism. But there is an important additional reaction in this modification - the Ce<sup>4+</sup>  ions react with the Ru<sup>2+</sup> ions producing the Ce<sup>3+</sup>  and the Ru<sup>3+</sup> ions. The Ru<sup>3+</sup> ions fluoresce in UV whereas the Ru<sup>2+</sup> ions don't.
