step_by_step: |
  1.	This experiment should be performed only in a fume hood.
  2.	Pour about 10 ml of concentrated nitric acid into the beaker.
  3.	Prepare a pea size piece of magnesium. Place the metal into the beaker.
  4.	The reaction proceeds violently. A large amount of a brown gas is liberated. Since the reaction is exothermic the beaker is heated.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves. Be very careful handling nitric acid. Perform this experiment only in a fume hood or outdors. 
science_background: |
  Magnesium reacts with concentrated nitric acid producing nitrogen dioxide, magnesium nitrate and water.
  Mg + 4HNO<sub>3</sub> --> Mg(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2NO<sub>2</sub> + 2H2O
  The evaluated reddish-brown gas is nitrogen dioxide. Since nitrogen dioxide is a toxic gas this experiment should be performed only in a fume hood.
