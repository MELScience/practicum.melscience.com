step_by_step: |
  1. Prepare the solvent. Mix 200 ml of water and 30 mL of acetone in a 300-ml beaker.
  2. Add 7.5 ml of 1M sodium hydroxide solution and a small amount of bromothymol blue.
  3. Increase the volume of the resulting solution to 300 ml with water and mix.
  4. Divide the solution into 2 portions of 150 ml, pour each into a glass jar.
  5. Prepare solutions of tert-butyl halides. Dissolve 920 mg of t-butyl chloride in 10 ml of acetone. Dissolve 1370 mg of t-butyl bromide in 10 ml of acetone.
  6. Transfer the solution of tert-butyl chloride into the first jar and the solution of t-butyl bromide into the second jar.
  7. Close the jars and shake them.
  8. After some time there will be a color change from blue to yellow in the jar with t-butyl bromide. Much later, it will happen in the jar with a tert-butyl chloride.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Use gloves.
science_background: |
  Tert-butyl halide is suspect to alkaline hydrolysis like all haloalkanes.
  Hydrolysis of the t-butyl halide proceeds via a mechanism forming a carbocation (S<sub>N</sub>1).
  R-X -->  R+ --> R-OH 
  The reaction rate doesn't depend on the concentration of the nucleophile, but depends on the nature of the substrate. Bromine is a better leaving group than chloro, so the reaction with t-butyl bromide proceeds much faster. The color change of the indicator is due to changes in the reaction medium from alkaline to acid due to the formation of hydrogen bromide.
