step_by_step: |
  1. Ignite a piece of magnesium
  2. Put it in the beaker with water
safety_description: |
  The reaction is very rough! There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
  There will be an explosion - keep a safe distance.
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
science_background: |
  Burning magnesium reacts violently with water and hydrogen is produced Hydrogen is ignited by the heat given by the reaction of magnesium with water.
