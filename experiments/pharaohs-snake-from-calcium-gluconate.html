    title: Characterisation of the thermal decomposition of calcium gluconate monohydrate
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1.	Prepare a tablet of dry fuel and calcium gluconate tablets.
  2.	Ignite the dry fuel.
  3.	Use tweezers to put a few calcium gluconate tablets on burning dry fuel.
  4.	When calcium gluconate is exposed to heat it forms low density carbonaceous foam.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles.There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
science_background: |
  When calcium carbonate monohydrate is heated it demonstrates a huge volume expansion. It looks like a grey foam snake and is caused by vaporization of loosely bound water and dehydration of hydroxyl groups of the compound. When calcium gluconate is purolysed at temperature of dry fuel the reaction looks as follows:
  2C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>CaO<sub>14</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>  --> 22H<sub>2</sub>O + 21C + 2CaO + 3CO<sub>2</sub> 
  The snake is gray-colored because of the presence of calcium oxide and carbon mixture.
