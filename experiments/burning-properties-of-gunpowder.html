    title: How Fast Does Black Powder Burn?
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Take gunpowder (mixture of potassium nitrate and charcoal) and grind it with a ball mill various times. Thus the samples of different particles size gunpowder are obtained.
  2. Put a small amount of the gunpowder samples onto a nonflammable plate.
  3. Ignite each sample with a burner or a match.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
  There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
  Make sure there is nothing flammable nearby.
science_background: |
  The burning properties of gunpowder depend on the size of particles. The smaller size of gunpowder particles the more powerful the reaction, therefore more energy is released in a shorter time.
