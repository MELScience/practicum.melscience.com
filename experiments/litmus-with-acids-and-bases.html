step_by_step: |
  1. Pour water, an acid solution and an alkali solution into test-tubes.
  2. Add a few drops of litmus solution into each test-tube.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection and lab gloves.
  Avoid contact of the acid and base solutions with skin.
science_background: |
  Litmus is a mixture of different dyes. One of them is 7-hydroxyphenoxazone which has properties of a weak acid. In an acid solution it is present in a red colored protonated form. In a base solution OH-group of 7-hydroxyphenoxazone dissociates and forms H<sup>+</sup> ions. The dissociated form of 7-hydroxyphenoxazone is blue. In neutral solutions litmus is violet.
