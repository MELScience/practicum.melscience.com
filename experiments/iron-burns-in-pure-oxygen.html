step_by_step: |
  1. Fill the Erlenmeyer flask with a stopper by pure oxygen. After this close the flask.
  2. Ignite the iron coil using the Bunsen burner.
  3. Carefully open the Erlenmeyer flask, place ignited iron into it, and close the flask again.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection.
  There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
  Make sure there is nothing flammable nearby.
science_background: |
  There is about 20% (by volume) oxygen in air, and due to this, iron rarely burns in air.
  Pure oxygen is a very strong oxidizing agent. The combustion reaction is dramatically stronger in presences of pure oxygen.
