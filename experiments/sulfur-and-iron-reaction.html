step_by_step: |
  1.	Prepare а mixture of powdered iron and sulfur in weight ratio 7:4.
  2.	Put some glass wool to the test tube opening. 
  3.	Fix the test tube on a stand.
  4.	Gently heat the test tube with a gas burner.
  5.	The mixture starts to glow.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves.Perform this experiment in a well ventilated room. 
science_background: |
  When the test tube is heated sulfur melts and the reaction between the components begins:
  Fe + S --> FeS
  Iron (II) sulfide is produced. This reaction is highly exothermic. Energy is released in form of light and heat.
