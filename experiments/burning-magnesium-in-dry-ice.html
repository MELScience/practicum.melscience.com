step_by_step: |
  1. Take two blocks of dry ice and make a cavity in one of them.
  2. Put magnesium (piece or chips) in the cavity. 
  3. Ignite magnesium using a burner and after this quickly cover the burning magnesium by another block of dry ice.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.
  There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready. Use safety screens to avoid dissemination sparks and flame.
  Make sure that there are no highly flammable substances or materials nearby.
  Don't look directly at the flame.
  You should be at a distance of 2-3 meters from the flame.
science_background: |
  Initially magnesium reacts with oxygen in the air. Heat of this reaction initiates the second reaction - between magnesium and carbon dioxide. Both of these reactions do not proceed without heated magnesium.
