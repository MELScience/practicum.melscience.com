step_by_step: |
  1. Secure a piece of chalk in a jaw clamp of a laboratory stand.
  2. Heat the piece of chalk with a burner. A few minutes later the piece glows brilliant white light.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection and lab gloves.
science_background: |
  Chalk consists of calcium carbonate. It decomposes under heating to form calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. Calcium oxide (or quicklime) luminesces at a high temperature - heated quicklime emits photons of white light, and the energy of heat converts to the energy of light.
