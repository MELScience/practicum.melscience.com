step_by_step: |
  1. Take a very small amount of potassium dichromate and dissolve it in 30-40 ml of water in a 250 ml heat resistant flask.
  2. Add about 5 ml of dilute sulfuric acid and mix. You have a orange solution.
  3. Add about 10 ml of dilute sodium hydroxide solution and shake the mixture. Now you have a yellow solution.
  4. Add a small amount of acid to the flask to make the solution orange.
  5. Add a small amount of sodium hydroxide to the flask to make the solution yellow.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Be careful with the acid and sodium hydroxide solutions! Don't drink or eat potassium dichromate and chromium-containing solutions, they are very toxic!
science_background: |
  The occurring process involves the equilibrium between chromate(VI), dichromate(VI) and hydrogen ions.
  2CrO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup><sub>(aq)(yellow)</sub> + 2H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> <--> Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2-</sup><sub>(aq)(orange)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O.
  Chemical equilibrium behaves according to the Le Chatelierâ€™s principle. It can be stated as "When a system at equilibrium is subjected to change in concentration, temperature, volume, or pressure, then the system readjusts itself to (partially) counteract the effect of the applied change and a new equilibrium is established."
  The addition of acid shifts the equilibrium to the right, producing more orange-colored dichromate(VI) ions. The addition of hydroxide ions causes the concentration of hydrogen ions to decrease, and this brings the equilibrium back to the left-hand side, regenerating yellow chromate(VI) ions.
