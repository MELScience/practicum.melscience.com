    language: ru

step_by_step: |
  1. Put a small piece of white phosphorus in the test-tube with water.
  2. Pour some water in a glass and heat it.
  3. Place the test-tube with phosphorus in the glass to melt phosphorus. Periodically carefully shake the test tube (phosphorus mustn't contact with air!). Fully melt phosphorus.
  4. Connect a glass tube to an oxygen source (i.e. balloon with reducing valve).
  5. Place the glass tube into the test-tube so the end of tube is near the surface of phosphorus.
  6. Slowly bubble oxygen through the water. 
safety_description: |
  Wear lab goggles and gloves.
  White phosphorus is very toxic and chemically active!
science_background: |
  White phosphorus is a very reactive substance and is easy oxidized by oxygen. It is needed to melt phosphorus to increase its reactivity. When phosphorus reacts with oxygen small explosions occur under water.
