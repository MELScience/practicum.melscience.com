step_by_step: |
  1. Do this experiment in a draught cupboard or outdoors.
  2. Take a heat-resistant glass bowl.
  3. Pour a small amount of concentrated sulfuric acid into the bowl. Be careful with concentrated acid.
  4. Lower food into the acid. You can use a hamburger, french fries, chewing gum, candy or other.
  5. After some time, take a pair of tweezers and remove products from the acid.
  6. Neutralize acid after the experiment.

  Do this experiment in a draught cupboard or outdoors. Use a heat-resistant bowl. Be careful with concentrated acid - use safety goggles, a protective gown and gloves. Neutralize acid after the experiment.
science_background: |
  Our food is a complex mixture of organic compounds of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Organic compounds, such as glucose, react with sulfuric acid and form coal or carbon dioxide.
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 12H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> --> 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 12SO<sub>2</sub> + 18H<sub>2</sub>O
  It does not matter what kind of food we will use in this experiment. The dissolving of food in sulfuric acid is similar to the digestion process. In our stomach there is hydrochloric acid, which dissolves the products we eat.
