step_by_step: |
  1. Chlorine gas production is needed for this experiment. For the synthesis of chlorine gas use a round-bottom flask with about 5 g of potassium permanganate inside and dropping funnel filled with hydrochloric acid. Dropwise add hydrochloric acid to potassium permanganate to produce chlorine gas.
  2. Place the silicon powder in a porcelain boat in a glass tube.
  3. Connect one end of the tube with a chlorine gas feed and another one with the product collector. Produced chlorine gas from the round-bottom flask should pass through sulfuric acid for drying. Silicon tetrachloride may be collected in a cooling receiving vessel. For the absorption of chlorine, the vessel should be connected with the vessels filled with concentrated sodium hydroxide solution.
  4. When chlorine is being produced with a uniform rate and fills the apparatus, heat silicon with a burner.
  5. After 0.5 - 1 ml of product has been collected, finish heating of the tube and cool it in a steam of chlorine gas. 
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection and lab gloves.
  This experiment must be performed in a fume hood.
science_background: |
  Potassium permanganate reacts with hydrochloric acid forming chlorine (HCl+KMnO<sub>4</sub> = KCl + MnCl<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O). Silicon reacts with produced chlorine forming silicon tetrachloride, a yellow-orange liquid, which condenses in the receiving vessel.
