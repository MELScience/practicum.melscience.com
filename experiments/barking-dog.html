step_by_step: |
  1.	Prepare a large glass tube with stoppers.
  2.	Fill the tube with nitrogen monoxide gas.
  3.	Add about 6-8 ml of carbon disulphide. 
  4.	Mix the components.
  5.	Put the tube in a safety screen.
  6.	Ignite gases in the tube.
  7.	The mixture burns with a bright blue flame which moves along the tube.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles and gloves. This is a violent reaction. Keep a safe distance. There is a some fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
science_background: |
  In the  experiment Barking dog carbon disulphide reacts with nitrogen monoxide NO as follows:
  32NO + 8CS2 --> 16N2 + 8CO2 + 8SO2 + S8
  Nitrogen monoxide is used as a source of oxygen to burn the carbon disulphide molecule. The reaction is highly exothermic and is accompanied with emission of bright blue light. The origin of this light is burning sulfur which is formed in the reaction. As the flame goes down the tube it accelerates itself. The gas under the flame front is compressed. At some point depending on the length of the tube  it expands rapidly with barking or woofing sound.
