step_by_step: |
  1.	To perform this experiment you should prepare only one reagent - sodium acetate trihydrate. It is easy to obtain it from acetic acid solution (or vinegar) and sodium bicarbonate (or baking soda).
  2.	Fill the beaker with sodium acetate trihydrate.
  3.	Heat it in a water bath until it melts.
  4.	Cool it down â€“ place the beaker with the solution in an ice bath.
  5.	Wait for about half an hour.
  6.	To start freezing add some crystals of solid sodium acetate trihydrate to the supercooled liquid or touch the liquid with a stick.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles and  gloves.
science_background: |
  Sodium acetate trihydrate is a white crystalline solid at room temperature. Its melting point is 58 oC. When sodium acetate trihydrate is heated in a water bath it melts. After this it is cooled down but the substance still exists in a liquid state. This phenomenon is called supercooling. This state is very unstable. When some kind of disturbance is introduced to the system sodium acetate trihydrate rapidly freezes and becomes solid.
