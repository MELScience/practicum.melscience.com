step_by_step: |
  1.	Prepare water solution of hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid.
  2.	Add a few drops of concentrated components to the flask with 200 ml of water.
  3.	Mix them carefully.
  4.	Add some crystals of potassium dichromate to the solution.
  5.	Observe the formation of blue clouds and oxygen bubbles.
  6.	For the second part of the experiment we need to obtain chromil chloride. This part should be performed in a fume hood.
  7.	Put some potassium dichromate and sodium chloride into the beaker.
  8.	Add some concentrated sulfuric acid.
  9.	The orange vapor of chromil chloride is produced.
  10.	Take the flask with fresh water solution of hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid and pour the gas to it. Chromil chloride is more dense then air, so it can be poured out of the beaker easily.
  11.	When orange vapor touches the solution surface it turns to blue clouds.

science_background: |
  In this experiment the formation of blue chromium(VI) peroxide(CrO5)  is observed.  When potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) crystals are added to the flask, they react with potassium dichromate as follows:
  K2Cr2O7 + H2SO4 + H2O2 --> 2 CrO5 + K2SO4 + 5H2O
  Chromium(VI) peroxide(CrO5)  is an unstable substance and reacts again with release of oxygen gas. 
  2CrO5 + 7H2O2 + 3H2SO4 --> Cr2(SO4)3 + 10H2O + 7O2
  In the second part of the experiment  the orange chromil chloride vapor is produced when potassium dichromate and sodium chloride are mixed with concentrated sulfuric acid:
  K2Cr2O7 + 4NaCl + 6H2SO4 --> 2CrO2Cl2 + 2KHSO4 + 4NaHSO4 +3H2O
  When the gas reaches the solution surface it reacts with water forming dichromate ions. Dichromate ions in turn react with hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid producing chromium peroxide.
  CrO2Cl2 + 2H2O --> H2CrO4 + 2HCl
  H2CrO4 + H2SO4 + H2O2 --> 2 CrO5 + H2SO4 + 5H2O
