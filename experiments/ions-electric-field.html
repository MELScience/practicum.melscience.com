step_by_step: |
  1. There are two approaches for performing this experiment - on a filter paper and in a U-tube. Consider only the option on a paper.
  2. Prepare the solution of [Cu(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]CrO<sub>4</sub>. Pour half a spatula of copper sulfate pentahydrate into a test tube. Then, add 2 ml of aqueous ammonia. Stir the mixture to complete dissolution of the copper sulfate. Add about a quarter of a spatula of potassium chromate and stir the resulting mixture.
  3. Carefully apply the resulting solution to form a line across the filter paper.
  4. Dry the filter paper. You can repeat steps 3 and 4 several times, applying the solution to the same line. Thus, the experiment will be more spectacular.
  5. Moisten the filter paper with the solution of sodium sulfate.
  6. Fill two Petri dishes with sodium sulfate and drop the ends of the filter paper into them.
  7. Lower electrodes into the Petri dishes. Pass electricity for at least 15 minutes.
  8. Observe the migration of ions.

  Wear eye protection goggles.
science_background: |
  This experiment demonstrates the migration of ions in an electric field. Cations of ammine copper which are colored blue, move toward the negatively charged electrode (cathode), and chromate-anions which are colored in yellow, move towards the positively charged electrode (anode).
