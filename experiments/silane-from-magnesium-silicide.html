step_by_step: |
  1. Preparation of magnesium silicide. Put several grams of magnesium into a test tube.
  2. Add excess of sand to the test tube.
  3. Heat the test tube using a gas burner until the magnesium is melted and reacted with the sand.
  4. Cool the resulting mixture and pour it into water.
  5. Observe the vigorous combustion of silane in air.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. Open air or hood. Non-combustible materials must be around.
science_background: |
  Magnesium silicide undergoes a complete hydrolysis to form a very reactive gas - silane. Silicon in silane, which is in oxidation state -4 is a very strong reducing agent, whereby the material ignites spontaneously in air.
