step_by_step: |
  1. Prepare solutions of NaI and HgCl2.
  2. Put the flask with the solution of NaJ on a magnetic stirrer.
  3. Stir it to form a vortex.
  4. Add a small amount (about 1-2 ml) of HgCl2 to the central part of the vortex. The orange tornado will be observed. 
safety_description: |
  Wear goggles and disposable gloves. Due to toxicity of mercury(II) salts this experiment is hazardous.
science_background: |
  When HgCl2 is added to the NaI solution a reaction between the components takes place:
  HgCl2 + NaI = HhI2 (precipitate) + 2NaCl
  HgI2 is highly insoluble in water. Yellow-orange particles of the precipitate formed during reaction color the solution. In the vortex the HgI2 concentration is higher than in other parts of the solution. At a distance from the central part of the flask it reacts with the excess of NaI as follows:
  HgI2 + 2NaI = Na 2(HI4)
  The product of this reaction is colorless and soluble. The equilibrium between soluble and insoluble products of the reactions is the reason why on a macroscopic level something resembling a tornado is observed.
